        <div class="entry"><p>The algorithm of constructing EFT is simple, as follow. (Remark that this algorithm holds not only for fields, but also for any other physical object which has a <em>spectrum</em>.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Propose the fields and their types (such as tensor, or spinor) that the theory involves; and symmetries that the theory must keep. This can be <em>guessed</em> via physical situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write down the <em>most general</em> action constructed by those fields, satisfying all symmetry restrictions in 1, with a UV and IR cut-off of the spectra of fields. Usually, this action has infinitely many terms; but not always so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perform re-scaling of spectrum, so that the energy-scale of the physical process cared about, usually characterized by the cut-offs of spectra, is absorbed into other quantities in action, <em>removed from spectra</em>, and involved into the coefficients in the action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dependence of re-scaled coefficients on energy-scale can effect which terms dominate the theory and which are negligible under a given energy-scale of physical process. (For different energy-scale, it maybe different terms that dominate.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First make an educated guess, that is, pick several largest coefficients, whose terms are proposed to have the dominate role in the theory, while neglect the others; then do calculation with this reduced action; and then comparing your results with experiments, fixing the parameters (now you have the least number of parameters).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it fits, that OK. If not, then involve the term that is guessed as sub-dominate into your calculation, still neglecting the left that were neglected. Then re-do all the procedure, to see if your theory fits the experiments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Re-do step 6 again and again, until it does fit, or until your theory contains so many parameters so that it is “non-trust-able”.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, this is the “truth” we are seeking for. If so, it’s boring.</p>
