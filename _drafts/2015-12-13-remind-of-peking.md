title: Remind of Peking
---


It has been ten months since I left Peking. After the leaving, I spent three months at home, and the left seven months "on the road". Verily, "on the road" am I in the state -- I traveled from Xiamen to Yunnan, from islands to mountains. Now, reminding of Peking, the city fulfilled with human-beings, left no room for natural, or the city fulfilled with civilization, left no room for original, I realize what makes it as special.

It is special for its communications -- communion of ideas, of knowledge, and of anything commutative. People talk in cafes, in offices, even in park. Crowding is the base of communion, without which communication is hard to form.
