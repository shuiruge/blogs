### Comments on Husserl

Camus goes against Husserl, stating that what he creates is another God, for the reason as follow. The same as Nietzsche, Husserl proposes that all is _ruled by the rules in our cosmos_.  That is, all that happens is but representations, underlying which we have no right to make choice, since all has been determined by the rules in our cosmos. Can we distinguish such void of right in making choice by ourselves from the result of existing a traditional God? Camus, however, goes against such an equivalent God -- He proposes that there still is room for making choice by ourselves.

But, this rises the confusion of Camus, that is, if there is such room in nature, then the burden of making choice is left to our shoulder. The burden is questing how to make choice, and why it is so. We, then, call for the rule helping us make choice, but hear no echo. Without the aid of God and the rules in our cosmos, can such a rule exist forsooth? For instance, as a "template" can  the ascetic Jesus help us make temporal choice within a sudden flash. But, of being ascetic, what is the reason, the motivation?!
