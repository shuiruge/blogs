### Comments on Epicurus

Epicurus meets the mortality of his life. This is his greatest anguish, but an inevitable one. The inevitability makes his rebel _metaphysical_, that is, the rebel that can never be established in real world, but only in spirit is it permitted.

So, what Epicurus rebels is not his mortality fate, but the implication relation from the mortality, representing the physical condition his fate provides, to the feeling of anguish. His triumph is making the original anguish happiness, But what is the tunnel of this transcending?



### Comments on Husserl

Camus goes against Husserl, stating that what he creates is another God (c.f. _The Myth of Sisyphus_), for the reason as follow. The same as Nietzsche, Husserl proposes that all is *ruled by the rules in our cosmos*.  That is, all that happens is but representations, underlying which we have no right to make choice, since all has been determined by the rules in our cosmos. Can we distinguish such void of right in making choice by ourselves from the result of existing a traditional God? Camus, however, goes against such an equivalent God -- He proposes that there still is room for making choice by ourselves.

But, this rises the confusion of Camus, that is, if there is such room in nature, then the burden of making choice is left to our shoulder. The burden is questing how to make choice, and why it is so. We, then, call for the rule helping us make choice, but hear no echo. Without the aid of God and the rules in our cosmos, can such a rule exist forsooth? For instance, as a "template" can  the ascetic Jesus help us make temporal choice within a sudden flash. But, of being ascetic, what is the reason, the motivation?!

This constantly questing is one main topic in _The Rebel_.


### Comments on Nietzsche

After slaying God, Nietzsche meets the same confusion as Camus, the burden of making choice. He employs the same idea as Husserl, that is, all is ruled by the rules in our cosmos, all is determined thence. This is _the complete yea_. Yea to everything means the absence of rebel. Yea to everything in the burning life means the absolute ascetic, the yielding in battle.

This is why Nietzsche goes against Christianity, but advocating for the human Jesus, his _superman_, his "proven" ascetic.
