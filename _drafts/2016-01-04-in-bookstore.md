In a bookstore will I be working , for two months at least. Books, lots of books, on philosophy, on art, and on literature, must I read. Must I read.

I am still in excited; and whether can I get of out this excitement is still unknown. This is what I am feeling. I do not know what I will feel after working there. `Tujour travaille` must I say.
