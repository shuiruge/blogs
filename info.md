COI!

This is the INFO of my blog.

I was a student studying astrophysics, cosmology. Now I am having fun with machine-learning and data-analysis in a company.

I'm a linux user. I was using a lisp-like language, Mathematica, for seven years. Now I turn to play with Python and Haskell. And sometimes having to write Java and C.

I usually write blogs in Chinese, but sometimes in English.

If you want to e-mail to me, my address is shuiruge@hotmail.com.
