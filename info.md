COI!

This is the info-page of my blog.

I used to be a graduate student studying cosmology. Now I am having fun with machine-learning and data-analysis in a company.

I am a Linux user. After using a lisp-like language, Mathematica, for seven years, now I turn to play with Python and Haskell, sometimes Java and C also.

I usually write blogs in Chinese, but sometimes in English.

If you want to e-mail to me, my address is shuiruge@whu.edu.cn.
