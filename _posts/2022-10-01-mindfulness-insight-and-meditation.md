## Mindfulness

When something is _perceived_, [^italics-convention] it affects us. [^be-perceived-and-affected] The more it affects us, the more prominent it is perceived.

We can only perceive things through our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. [^body-and-mind] These six sense organs are, thus, called the _six sense doors_. [^doors]

**_Mindfulness_ is the mind that can be aware of [^be-aware-of] what's being perceived at all the six sense doors in every moment.** [^Tejaniya-etc] It efficiently collects information without missing anything that affects us.

## Insight

Human brain is a great simulator. Indeed, without any effort, it simulates a world and a whole story therein, which we call dream. With the same capacity, autonomously and effortlessly, it learns conditional relationships, which predict what will happen if somethings are taken, that is, simulations of reality. [^brain-learning] [^brain-capability] **_Insight_ is the learned brain.** And this very fact of human brain forms the basis of insight arising.

If all that have been perceived are known, then the brain will learn what are conditions and what are conditioned by, filtering out what are irrelevant. Contrarily, if something relevant [^what-is-relevant] goes unnoticed, then either the brain won't learn, or the learned brain is biased since the materials are partial. So, **mindfulness is the essential and sufficient condition of insight arising.** [^mindfulness-insight-example]

## Meditation

In human brain, the unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. A _perceived object_ is a pack of processed information projected into consciousness from a module of the unconscious. It's projected so that other modules can receive the information, which is the only way that modules communicate with each other, and that objects in the inner and outer worlds can be perceived. [^modularity] Furthermore, if a module has projected a pack of processed information into consciousness, the others cannot project until the current passes away [^information-overlap]; and the consumption of the projected needs time, duration of which cannot be arbitrarily short, but finitely limited. [^brain-perception] [^perceptive-process] From this modular perspective, _awareness_ is also a module of the unconscious, faithfully telling the others what's happening in consciousness. [^awareness] Based on these facts, **as long as awareness remains highly active, there's no place for things that are perceived without being aware.** [^awareness-remains-highly-active] And, **_meditation_ is the methodical practice aiming to reinforce our awareness to be continuously and highly active.**

A beginner who performs a task tries hard to coordinate modules of the unconscious so that they work together to accomplish the task. Involving serial consciousness makes it slow; and competing to occupy consciousness from other modules during the process frequently interrupts it; it is so hard felt. But, with repeated practice, these modules are gradually connected altogether; and a new module of the unconscious is created. Working individually without employing consciousness, it becomes fast and uninterrupted. This is what a practice results from the modular perspective.

The task in meditative practice is

    perceived object A → intent to be aware → aware of A,

for any perceived object. With repeated practice at every moment of perception, connection between modules of perceptions and of awareness are built, so that a perception will trigger awareness unconsciously, that is,

    perceived object A → aware of A.

This is how meditative practice makes awareness constantly active. With repeated practice, awareness closely follows what's being perceived. No matter what you are doing, attending to the objects to be noticed, awareness appears as if falling upon these objects, as if striking at them, without a break. In this situation, the mind won't miss anything that comes to it (through the six sense doors); and the details of things are revealed to mind on their own.

## FAQ

### Relations between Mindfulness and Concentration

When we concentrate on something, our attention is continuously kept on it without digression. Mindfulness is a kind of concentration, but the thing we concentrated on is one and unique. That is, concentrating on awareness of what's being perceived at all the six sense doors.

### Mental Label Technique

At the beginning stage of meditation, to guarantee awareness, mental labeling what's being perceived will be helpful. But this technique is not essential; and if you feel uncomfortable with it, simply keep awareness without any mental label. Being aware is what is essential.

### Relation with Buddhism

In (Theravada) Buddhism, the goal is to penetrate into the body-mind process to access the three specific insights: impermanence, suffering, and no-self. Again, to gain insight, mindfulness and, thus, meditation are essential.

### What is Nibbana

When awareness becomes extremely strong so that the perceptive process is constantly occupied by what is projected only from the single awareness, we experience the Nibbana. In this situation, all but awareness are excluded from consciousness.

[^italics-convention]: Throughout this note, italics is employed in two cases:

    - for books and articles, which are listed in the "References" section;
    - for defining proper nouns, usually at the place where they first appear in the text. Note that these words have different meanings than they do in everyday speech.

[^be-perceived-and-affected]: Indeed, when a sound is perceived, we become capable of thinking about the sound; an intention to walk makes the body start walking; and walking leads to a constant change in posture accompanied by a series of mental activities in order to reach the destination. Contrarily, when we plug the ears, so that sound cannot be perceived, it leaves no effect on us.

    According to the chapter "What Is Consciousness Good For?" of _Consciousness and the Brain_, at the level of neuroscience, there're two types of perception, either with or without consciousness. Both of them can affect us. But, since the unconscious is transient and locally restricted in human brain, leaving no impression on memory, it's incapable of making decision, such as intending to walk, and is implastic. So, throughout this note, we only consider the things that are perceived with consciousness involved.

    So, when something is perceived, it affects us in the following way. It first affects our mental or conscious state, which in turn arouses bodily or/and mental activities.

[^body-and-mind]: Body involves movements and feelings. And mind involves emotions and thoughts. They are more broad and more subtle than the other sense organs.

[^doors]: In _The Progress of Insight_, Nyanaponika Thera noted,

    > "Door" is a figurative expression for the sense organs (which, including the mind, are sixfold), because they provide, as it were, the access to the world of objects.

[^be-aware-of]: When we are aware of something, we simply know it, realizing its appearance, as if saying "Ah! It comes". It's effortless.

[^Tejaniya-etc]: At the end of _When Awareness Becomes Natural_, Sayadaw U Tejaniya provided a concise declaration:

    > Your work is to be gently aware of what is being perceived at all your sense doors in this moment. That is all!

    Also in the chapter “Practical Instructions” of _Manual of Insight_:

    > True insight practice is an awareness of all of the mental and physical phenomena that constantly arise at the six sense doors.

[^brain-learning]: It's the experiential materials that human brain learns autonomously and efficiently. Textual materials, however, can't be so, since they are absent during the evolution of human brain. For example, as we all know, the best way of learning a new language is encoding them to experiential materials.

[^brain-capability]: This capability of human brain has been discussed by François Roustang in his book _What is Hypnosis?_, chapter "The Precondition". The author illustrates it by discussing dream, imagination and how baby interacts with the real world.

[^what-is-relevant]: Notice that it's the learned brain that can figure out what's relevant. Before learning, everything that is perceived has the potential to be relevant.

[^mindfulness-insight-example]: Here's an example illustrating the relation between mindfulness and insight arising:

    Suppose you are a first year graduate student. You found an interesting academic paper, and started reading. At first, you read slowly and carefully, word by word. Several pages later, you began reading faster, since you found you cannot understand what the authors wrote. This is easy to understand. At first, you will not encounter much unfamiliar concepts. But the more content you have read, the more unfamiliar concepts will you meet. You will feel confused once it exceeds a threshold. In this situation, it's a waste of time to continue reading. Nevertheless, this is not that obvious for a first year graduate student. Finally, late at night, you gave up.

    If you were mindful, you would be aware of the body-mind process, the impatience, the thoughts of complaint, your scratching of head. It's a hint of re-considering the strategy, of re-evaluating the value of this paper. In the end, the brain would learn this. In the next time, you would be more experienced and know when to pause and adjust.

    Contrarily, if you were trapped in the anxious feeling, or in the complaints, you would not be aware of what's happening in your body and mind. In this situation, the brain wouldn't learn. And, in the next time, you would repeat this failure.

[^modularity]: A _module_, however, shall not be identified by a location in human brain, but is that which accomplishes the procession and projection, a step of perceptive process. It is either compound, of many interconnected parts of human brain, or elemental.

    Furthermore, a module can be a combination of many sub-modules, each accomplishing a more fundamental step, cooperating with each other through consciousness in due order, so that the total effect is the step accomplished by the combined. And this module, combined with some others, can form a super-module. This is an effective theory, remind us of the Kadanoff's renormalization group in physics. And, it's in this perspective that any step of perceptive process has a corresponding module that accomplishes it. A more fundamental step it is, a more underlying module it corresponds to.

[^information-overlap]: This is plausible, since if two or more packs of processed information from different modules are projected into consciousness at the same time, they will overlap so that the information cannot be effectively received by other modules.

[^brain-perception]: These facts are abstractions of what's happening in human brain. Like all other abstractions, circles or squares for instance, the relevant skeletons are extracted, while the irrelevant details are neglected. Abstraction simplifies the situations, providing us a clearer perspective.

    But, for seeking the details, extensive and comprehensive experimental and theoretical illustrations, and even numerical simulations, can be found in the chapter "Theorizing Consciousness" of _Consciousness and the Brain_ and the references therein. And for the modularity and concurrency of the unconscious, see also the chapter "Fathoming Unconscious Depths" of the same book.

[^perceptive-process]: So, the perceptive process must be a temporal sequence like

        ⋯ → perceived object A → perceived object B → perceived object C → ⋯,

    during which each perceived object occupies a time quantum in consciousness; and patterns like

        ⋯ → perceived object A + perceived object B + perceived object C → ⋯,

    where the perceived objects A, B, and C occupy a single time quantum, are excluded.

[^awareness]: From the modular perspective, we know that, whenever something is perceived, there must be a module by whom information is projected into consciousness. So too it is for perceiving what's being perceived; and the module that accomplishes this is awareness.

    (Remark that whether awareness is a single module or multiple is not ensured. It may be a collection of modules, each for a sense door.)

[^awareness-remains-highly-active]: When awareness remains highly active, the perceptive process, in a simplified and indicative form, will be like

        ⋯ → perceived object A → aware of A → perceived object B → aware of B → ⋯,

    where the terms "aware of A" and "aware of B" are packs of information projected from awareness. During a time quantum, once awareness arises, other objects will be excluded. So, all that are perceived are now realized.
