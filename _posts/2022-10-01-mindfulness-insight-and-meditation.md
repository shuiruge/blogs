## Mindfulness[^convention]

When something is _perceived_, it affects us.[^be-perceived-and-affected] The more it affects us, the more prominent it is perceived.

We can only perceive things through our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.[^body-and-mind] These six sense organs are, thus, called the _six sense doors_.[^doors]

**_Mindfulness_ is the attention that can be aware of[^be-aware-of] what is being perceived at all the six sense doors in every moment.**[^Tejaniya-etc] It's stable, effortless, spacious, and sharp. It efficiently collects information without missing anything that affects us.

## Insight

Human brain is a great simulator. Indeed, without any effort, it simulates a world and a whole story therein, which we call dream. With the same capacity, autonomously and effortlessly, it learns conditional relationships, which predict what will happen if somethings are taken, that is, simulations of reality.[^brain-learning] [^brain-capability] **_Insight_ is the learned brain.** And this very fact of human brain forms the basis of insight arising.

If all that have been perceived are known, then the brain will learn what are conditions and what are conditioned by, filtering out what are irrelevant. Contrarily, if something relevant[^what-is-relevant] goes unnoticed, then either the brain won't learn, or the learned brain is biased since the materials are partial. So, **mindfulness is the essential and sufficient condition of insight arising.**[^mindfulness-insight-example]

## Meditation

**_Meditation_ is the progressive practice aiming to train the attention to become mindful.** The working principle here is the very fact that human brain cannot perceive two distinct objects at the same time.[^brain-perception] Once the awareness becomes continuous, there's no place for things that are perceived without awareness. [^model]

Briefly, meditation rests us in a continuous state of observation or noticing on what is prominently perceived at the six sense doors, such that there's almost no period during which awareness is absent. With repeated practice, awareness becomes continuous without any effort. No matter what you are doing, attending to the objects to be noticed, awareness appears as if falling upon these objects, as if striking at them, without a break. In this situation, the mind won't miss anything that comes to it (through the six sense doors); and the details of things are revealed to mind on their own. The article _Satipatthana Vipassana_ concisely and sufficiently illustrates how meditation is performed in detail.

## FAQ

### Relations between Mindfulness and Concentration

When we concentrate on something, our attention is constantly kept on it without digression. Mindfulness is a kind of concentration, but the thing we concentrated on is one and unique. That is, concentrating on awareness of what is being perceived at all the six sense doors.

### Mental Label Technique

At the beginning stage of meditation, to guarantee awareness, mental labeling what is aware of will be helpful. But this technique is not essential; and if you feel uncomfortable with it, simply keep awareness without any mental label. Being aware is what is essential.

### Relation with Buddhism

In (Theravada) Buddhism, the goal is to penetrate into the body-mind process to access the three specific insights: impermanence, suffering, and no-self. Again, to gain insight, mindfulness and, thus, meditation are essential.

[^convention]: Throughout this note, italics is employed in two cases:

    - for books and articles, which are listed in the "References" section;
    - for defining proper nouns, usually at the place where they first appear in the text. Note that these words have different meanings than they do in everyday speech.

[^be-perceived-and-affected]: Indeed, when a sound is perceived, we become capable of thinking about the sound; an intention to walk makes the body start walking; and walking leads to a constant change in posture accompanied by a series of mental activities in order to reach the destination. Contrarily, when we plug the ears, so that sound cannot be perceived, it leaves no effect on us.

    According to the chapter "What Is Consciousness Good For?" of _Consciousness and the Brain_, at the level of neuroscience, there're two types of perception. One is purely subliminal, such as unconditioned reflex. The other involves consciousness. Both of them can affect us. But, since subliminal is transient and locally restricted in human brain, leaving no impression on memory, it's incapable of making decision, such as intending to walk, and implastic. So, throughout this note, we only consider the things that are perceived with consciousness involved.

    So, when something is perceived, it affects us in the following way. It first affects our mental or conscious state, which in turn arouses bodily or/and mental activities.

[^body-and-mind]: Body involves movements and feelings. And mind involves emotions and thoughts. They are more broad and more subtle than the other sense organs.

[^doors]: In _The Progress of Insight_, Nyanaponika Thera noted,

    > "Door" is a figurative expression for the sense organs (which, including the mind, are sixfold), because they provide, as it were, the access to the world of objects.

[^be-aware-of]: When we are aware of something, we simply know it, realizing its appearance, as if saying "Ah! It comes". It's effortless.

[^Tejaniya-etc]: At the end of _When Awareness Becomes Natural_, Sayadaw U Tejaniya provided a concise declaration:

    > Your work is to be gently aware of what is being perceived at all your sense doors in this moment. That is all!

    Also in the chapter “Practical Instructions” of _Manual of Insight_:

    > True insight practice is an awareness of all of the mental and physical phenomena that constantly arise at the six sense doors.

[^brain-learning]: It's the experiential materials that human brain learns autonomously and efficiently. Textual materials, however, can't be so, since they are absent during the evolution of human brain. For example, as we all know, the best way of learning a new language is encoding them to experiential materials.

[^brain-capability]: This capability of human brain has been discussed by François Roustang in his book _What is Hypnosis?_, chapter "The Precondition". The author illustrates it by discussing dream, imagination and how baby interacts with the real world.

[^what-is-relevant]: Notice that it's the learned brain that can figure out what is relevant. Before learning, everything that is perceived has the potential to be relevant.

[^mindfulness-insight-example]: Here's an example illustrating the relation between mindfulness and insight arising:

    Suppose you are a first year graduate student. You found an interesting academic paper, and started reading. At first, you read slowly and carefully, word by word. Several pages later, you began reading faster, since you found you cannot understand what the authors wrote. This is easy to understand. At first, you will not encounter much unfamiliar concepts. But the more content you have read, the more unfamiliar concepts will you meet. You will feel confused once it exceeds a threshold. In this situation, it's a waste of time to continue reading. Nevertheless, this is not that obvious for a first year graduate student. Finally, late at night, you gave up.

    If you were mindful, you would be aware of the body-mind process, the impatience, the thoughts of complaint, your scratching of head. It's a hint of re-considering the strategy, of re-evaluating the value of this paper. In the end, the brain would learn this. In the next time, you would be more experienced and know when to pause and adjust.

    Contrarily, if you were trapped in the anxious feeling, or in the complaints, you would not be aware of what's going on in your body and mind. In this situation, the brain wouldn't learn. And, in the next time, you would repeat this failure.

[^brain-perception]: In the chapter "Analysis of Thought-Processes" of _A Manual of Abhidhamma_, a Theravada Buddhist perspective to this fact was explained. A very accessible illustration can be found in the chapter "The Moments of Consciousness Model" of _The Mind Illuminated_.

[^model]: For illustrating the continuous awareness, consider a (maybe over-) simplified model. Since human brain cannot perceive two distinct objects at the same time, perception of objects must be a temporal sequence of single object, as

        ⋯ → object A → object A → object B → object C → ⋯.

    Continuous awareness is, thus, like

        ⋯ → object A → aware of A → object A → aware of A → object B → aware of B → ⋯,

    as if being a monitor of perception. This very fact of human brain excludes the pattern like

        ⋯ → object A → aware of A + object B → object C → ⋯,

    where the "aware of A" and the "object B" are perceived at the same time (unit), so that the later is unaware.
