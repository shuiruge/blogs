title: Plan

A fatal problem arises after moving to Dali. Before, in Deqin, I had little time to study, but studied well. Now, however, I have plenty of time, but study little. It is a paradox!

So, I need a plan, and of course the willpower to follow it. The plan is as follow.

- I shall get up in 6:00.

- An one-day-plan is then determined, this is the first thing of one day -- sitting before a desk, thinking carefully of it.

- Once this plan is made, then fixed is it; only dangers can it be changed by.

- No matter what happens in this day, this plan must be done. Must not sleep until completing the plan.

- So, there is no fixed time for sleeping at night.
