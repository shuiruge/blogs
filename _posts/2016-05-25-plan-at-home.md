title: Plan at Home
---

After a long period of traveling, now I am at home. It is planed that:

- 5:30 get up
- 5:30 - 6:00 cook and eat
- 6:00 - 12:00 learn PST
- 12:00 - 12:30 cook and eat
- 12:30 - 17:00 read book and learn others including programming and category theory.
- 17:00 - 18:30 walk and run
- 18:30 - 19:00 cook and eat
- 19:00 - 21:00 learn PST
- 21:00 - 22:00 read book
- 22:00 - 5:30 sleep

Learning PST will spend 4 - 5 months.
