Hello, Absurd world!

<hr>

Followings are tests:


LaTeX:

$\alpha$, $$ \frac{1}{2} $$. And equation:

\begin{equation}
	( E-\hat{H}_0 ) \Psi = \hat{H}_{\rm{int}} \Psi \;,
\end{equation}

where markdown conflicts with LaTeX, since they both use underline, but in different ways.

I still have no idea on how to show LaTeX directly in Jekyll. So:

* Use additional plug-in of your browser instead to fulfill this function.
