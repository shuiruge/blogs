title: Anticipation, Synaptic Plasticity, and Introspection

## A Poem

Neurons are united together.  
to mediate a complex behavior.  
Connected by synapses,  
like the roads between blocks.  
A city of neurons has emerged.  
A brain as it is called. [^neural-network]  

Anticipation is an intention:  
when stimuli of a kind is received,  
a specific behavior is followed. [^anticipation]  
Stimulating a neuron might activate  
many pathways that succeeds.  
As many paths you can choose  
to go from a block in the city.  
But anticipation ensures  
only one pathway is to be activated,  
that from the stimuli to the behavior. [^modulation]  
Its synapses have to be facilitated,  
as the roads are broadened,  
so the pathway can beat the others,  
whenever the stimuli are received.  
Facilitation by chemical modulators.  
They are produced in the synapses,  
at each moment it is anticipated.  
Persist for a while, soon metabolized. [^chemical-modulators]  

When continually anticipate  
an anticipation without a break,  
produced more than metabolized,  
the chemical modulators accumulate.  
Concentrations rush high and  
plasticity is triggered.  
In a short period it forms  
long-lasting change in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity]  
By simply sustaining it,  
anticipation becomes a reality.  
As reality is so plastic.  

But mind desires to wander around.  
It must be carefully watched,  
for an anticipation can be sustained.  
An introspection that is persistent.  
For plasticity it is important.  

  [^neural-network]: Neurons are the cells used for processing electrical signals. A neuron accepts signals from some others by its branch-like input terminals. It then integrates the signals, propagates the result along a long channel called axon, and transmits to other neurons at the ends. For most neurons, at the output terminals of axon, the electrical signals have to be converted to chemical signals, called neurotransmitters, released from the output terminals to the input terminals of the successive neurons. These terminals are called synapses.

    A neuron is too simple to mediate behavior. Neurons must work together. Connected by synapses, they form a network. It is like a city. Neurons are tightly connected locally, like a lot of small towns. Between the towns are long distance connections, the highways. A complex behavior is then mediated by activating a cascade of neurons, a pathway in the network, like a path in the city, along which information is propagated and processed.

    For details, see chapter 3 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^anticipation]: Throughout this note, we use the word "anticipation" in this narrow sense. When we are looking for something red, we anticipate finding red object, where the stimuli come from seeing an object and the behavior is identifying if it is red. Before sleep, we anticipate feeling more and more relaxed as the clock ticks, where the stimuli come from hearing the clock ticks and the behavior is active relaxation. When practicing guitar, the stimuli come from playing a chord and the behavior is playing the successive one. Notice that anticipation is independent of the appearance of the stimuli; it is an intention, a mental activity.

  [^modulation]: As an example, when we are cued to detect red objects, the pathway that responsible for detecting red color is facilitated, so that whenever we see an object, this pathway has much higher probability of being activated, so that we can detect red object correctly but missing the objects with other colors. For details, see the paper _Attention enhances synaptic efficacy and signal-to-noise in neural circuits._

    The famous "invisible gorilla" experiment made by Daniel Simons is another example.

  [^chemical-modulators]: Neurotransmitters are received by receptors on the membranes of synapses. There are two kinds of receptors. One is ionotropic receptor, which mediates the propagation of electrical signals. It opens ion channels which in turn changes the membrane potential, converting chemical signals back to electrical signals. The other is metabotropic receptor, which modulates the propagation by modifying the strength of synapses. When specific molecules bind to a metabotropic receptor, it changes its shape and reveals some sites. These sites will activate specific enzyme-like substances, which then diffuse in the synapse to catalyze a series of chemical reactions that facilitate or inhibit the release or the reception of neurotransmitters. An activated metabotropic receptor is like a coffee machine, and inactive enzyme-like substances are exhausted workers. They drift to the coffee machine, drink espresso, and become energetic and capable of work. They will keep energetic for a while, from hundreds of milliseconds to minutes, then becomes exhausted again. The energetic workers are called modulators. Any time when a metabotropic receptor is activated, certain amount of the modulators are produced in the synapse.

    For the types of receptor, see chapter 11 of _Principles of Neural Science_. And for the details of metabotropic receptors, see chapter 14 of the same book.

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical modulators in the synapses along the modulated pathway are called also second messengers, such as protein kinase A. They will accumulate within the synapses. When their concentrations become sufficient, it is possible that the modulators diffuse into nucleus. Over there, with a series chemical reactions, they trigger the expression of DNA that produces the proteins used for building new synapses. This leads to an anatomical change in the synapses, a change that is long-lasting.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Example

Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to sustained the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath. The stimuli come from air striking the nasal cavity and the behavior is sensing the nasal sensation. Usually, we do not feel the nasal sensation when air strikes the nasal cavity. But when we anticipate like "sense the nasal sensation when in/out-breathe" at each inspiration and expiration, it is felt immediately that the nasal sensation caused by breathing stands out from the blurry background of mind. This is because the synapses along the pathway from the stimuli of air striking to the behavior of sensing the nasal sensation are facilitated, so it is ensured that, when air strikes the nasal cavity, it is this pathway, rather than any other that succeeds to the stimuli of air striking, that is activated. Even though subtle, it has indicated that the pathway from the stimuli to the behavior does exist and be modulable. This modulation is mediated by the chemical modulators in the synapses along the modulated pathway. With sustained effort of anticipating, the feeling comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. Details reveal themselves. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. This is the effect of accumulation of the chemical modulators. But, it will not last long. The mind is constantly searching for something attractive, something new. When the mind slips away, if it is detected in time, we bring the mind back to the anticipation again. Then, nothing is really interrupted and the accumulation goes on. Otherwise, the mind goes astray and soon the chemical modulators lose their concentrations. When the anticipation can be sustained, nothing stops the chemical modulators accumulating. Synaptic plasticity is then triggered in an extreme way. It is like forming highly emotional memory: long-lasting changes are made in a period that is short.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath alone, but for any anticipation to which a modulable pathway corresponds, since the principle behind is the same.
