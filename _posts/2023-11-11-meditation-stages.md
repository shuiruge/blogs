At the end of each paragraph, the range of pages in the book that this paragraph concerns is marked. For instance, "P.275-277" indicates that it starts at page 275 and ends at page 277.

## Insight

## Discerning Physical Object and Noting Mind

By diligent practice, practitioner finds the physical object and the mental noting come in pair. He observes that following the appearance of the physical object, there arises the mental noting. The physical object and the mental noting are separated phenomena. (P.275-277)

## Realizing Intention

By continuing his practice, practitioner **clearly** realizes the intention before bodily movement. (P.277-279)

At this stage, practitioner may experience unpleasant feelings, which will disappear when stop noting. He may see dream-like visions also. Or, he may feel lazy. (P.279-280)

## Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away

By continuing his practice, practitioner **clearly** realizes the disappearance of an object. Prior to this stage, he had to note new object that arose before the disappearance of the previous object, so that he cannot clearly realize the disappearance. So, now he can realize the appearance, duration, and disappearance of an object clearly. (P.280-281)

Then, practitioner finds the consciousness discrete, falling into a series of segments, and each object arises and passes away in its own segment. This is the knowledge of arising and passing away. Noting flows without much effort. TODO (P.281-282)

At this stage, practitioner is likely to see a bright light, to experience rapture, or to feel light and comfortable. (P.283-284)

## Knowledge of Dissolution

By continuing his practice, practitioner finds that object and the noting of it appear and disappear rapidly, so that he cannot realize the form or content of the object, but the instant disappearance. He may think there is something wrong with his noting, since he cannot realize the object clearly as before; but in fact, this is a sign of making progress. Now, the gap between adjacent segments becomes clear to him; he understands that segments are truly separated. (P.284-286)

Realized that everything is dissolving, unpleasant feelings may arise, and the pleasant feeling that arose previously now fades. Fear may arise since he realizes that nothing persists. Disenchantment may arise since he realizes that nothing exists (in the sense of lasting). Then, desire of escaping from these unpleasant feelings may arise. Or, he may reflect that practice is unpleasant since noting these weary things is disgusting. Because of these, he may feel impatient and unstable. (P.286-289)

## Equanimity towards Phenomena

By continuing the practice, noting the unpleasant feelings when they arise, these unpleasant feelings fade. Other unpleasant feelings, such as pain, stiffness, and itching, will not arise too. Now, practitioner experiences the dissolution with equanimity. (P.289-289)

The noting comes to be very sensitive and subtle, as if running by itself. While nothing invades his noting, practitioner feels delightful. (P.289-292)

## Fruition

### Entering Fruition

While continuing the practice in the stage _equanimity towards phenomena_, there is a sudden lift of the swiftness and clarity of noting during several moments; immediately after these moments, both object and noting mind disappear abruptly, and nothing arises. This indicates that, even if there are objects to see, to hear, to touch, and so on, he will not perceive any of them. This state of "emptiness" lasts shortly, from several moments to minutes. It is a sign of attaining the first fruition. (P.292-293) [^emptiness]

  [^emptiness]: Why does the very state of "emptiness" arise? One may expect that this is the limit of _knowledge of dissolution_. The noting mind is so strong that it pushes the dissolution to an edge where any object dissolves just at the moment of its arising. In this way, practitioner cannot perceive any object and just feels nothing arise.

### Fade of Fruition

When the state of "emptiness" fade, practitioner is left in a peaceful state for hours or days. During this period, he may feel that objects cannot be distinguished clearly, let alone noted. And after, when objects can be noted again, it is found that the ability of noting retrogresses to the stage _knowledge of arising and passing away_ rather than retrogressing to the beginning stage, which is _discerning physical object and noting mind_. (P.293-295)

### Re-entering Fruition

By continuing his practice after the fade of fruition, practitioner goes through the successive stages of sight, from the stage _knowledge of arising and passing away_ to _equanimity towards phenomena_, and experiences the first fruition again. This process will be much quicker than before since it starts in the middle of the progress. (P.295)

### Determinations

As the commentaries put, if practitioner predetermines the length of period of staying in the fruition absorption (that is, absorbed in the "emptiness"), he will experience so. In this situation, during his period of fruition absorption, he can easily emerge from the absorption and be absorbed into fruition again. (P.295-296)

During the process of re-entering fruition, practitioner can also predetermine the length of period of staying in each of the stages. When the predetermined period of current stage ends, the next stage will arise spontaneously or after resolving like "may the knowledge of â‹¯ arise". In this way, practitioner can en-enter fruition very soon. (P.296-297)

### Higher Fruitions

After attaining the first fruition, practitioner may continue his practice for attaining higher fruitions. He first determine the length of period of the process of entering the next higher fruition. "May the fruition that I have already attained no longer arise during this period of time; may the next higher path knowledge and fruition knowledge arise instead." So does he resolve [^resolve] and continue his practice. He goes through the stages from _knowledge of arising and passing away_ to _equanimity towards phenomena_, and enters the higher fruition. The state of "emptiness" then fades; and the practitioner retrogresses to the stage _knowledge of arising and passing away_. He repeats this process till attaining the fourth and the last fruition. (P.298-300)

  [^resolve]: Why shall he resolve so, rather than simply resolving "may the next higher path knowledge and fruition knowledge arise"? The reason is that, this kind of determination prevent him from reaching the fruition which he has attained. It ensures that the fruition he attains at the end of this process is indeed the next higher one.
