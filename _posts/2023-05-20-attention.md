## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: For the details of human brain as modularized network, see chapter 1 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Attention Is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] Paying attention with intent sensitizes the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is in focus. And ignoring, namely noticing without reacting by physical or mental deed, habituates the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is ignored. Importantly, both sensitization and habituation are chemically mediated. [^sensitization-and-habituation]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural pathways. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, transiently aroused by attractive stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. Reflexive attention also contributes modulating neural pathways because it interrupts voluntary attention and may spontaneously re-direct voluntary attention.

    For the details of attention types, see section 7.5 of _Cognitive Neuroscience_.

  [^sensitization-and-habituation]: The word "sensitize" brings to mind that paying attention to a part of your body will enhance the feeling there, or that hearing becomes more sensitive when you are cued to pay attention to a certain type of voice. Contrarily, the word "habituate" reminds of the situation when you get used to the terrible smell of toilet, or to the background noise you do not care about.

    For the details of sensitization and habituation, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Stable Attention Triggers Synaptic Plasticity

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable; it is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural pathways that are presently in focus become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized. In this situation, the chemical mediators cannot accumulate in synapses.

If, however, attention can be stabilized to what is going to focus on, then the chemical mediators will accumulate enough to trigger synaptic plasticity, leading to anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] The sensitization and the habituation then become long-lasting. In this way, we can plant what we want to cultivate, such as loving-kindness, and uproot what we want to eliminate, such as disturbing thoughts. [^loving-kindness-example]

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators that leads to sensitization are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within neurons. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to a long-term sensitization.

      TODO: explain for habituation.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^loving-kindness-example]: Here is an example illustrating how stabilizing attention works for cultivating loving-kindness and for uprooting hatred. To cultivate loving-kindness, first try to arouse a feeling of loving-kindness by, for instance, recalling something or someone related to loving-kindness; then stabilize attention onto this feeling, till the feeling shining alone in the mind. This triggers the neural plasticity that imprints loving-kindness on the mind, so that the feeling can persist. When loving-kindness persists in heart, hatred is naturally uprooted.

## Persistent Introspection Is the Only Ability Need for Stabilizing Attention

What happens when we try to stabilize attention onto some object? First, we focus on the object with intent, which sensitizes the relevant neural pathways so that the object comes to be distinct in the mind. This effect of sensitization may increase with time on its own, but may also decrease if disturbed. To stabilizing attention is to keep this effect of sensitization from decrease. To do so, we have to persistently observe the object so as to re-focus whenever the object is less distinct. The sooner the decrease is detected, the less effort will it take for re-focus. [^breath-example]

  [^breath-example]: Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to stabilize attention onto the nasal sensation of breath. First, we take effort to focus attention on the nasal sensation of breath. Immediately, it is felt that the nasal sensation stands out from the blurry background of mind. With sustained effort, it then comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. At this time, when you relax the effort, the distinctness of nasal sensation persists. This is the effect of sensitization. But, it will not last long. For example, while a honking bus passing through the window, your mind is disturbed and the nasal sensation is interrupted. But, once the bus has passed, the nasal sensation comes back. Other things, especially those attractive and offensive ones, may persist longer. They keep interrupting the nasal sensation so that it comes to be less distinct. At the beginning of the decrease, we can re-enhance the nasal sensation by taking a little effort of re-focus. But, if we cannot detect the disturbances in time, the nasal sensation will soon loss its distinctness, and finally merge into the blurry background of mind. The sensitization, thus, comes to an end.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the nasal sensation of breath alone, but for any kind of object, since the principle behind is the same.

For successfully applying this process to any object, we have to know what is distinctly perceived at every moment. With this ability only, can we stabilize attention to any object we want.

## Ability of Persistent Introspection Is Obtained by Stabilizing Attention onto Persistent Introspection

To obtain the mental ability of knowing what is distinctly perceived at every moment, we have to focus our attention on knowing what is distinctly perceived at the moment. From time to time, however, attention will slip away by its own. And we bring it back again and again, till it is temporally tamed to stay at the knowing autonomously. In this way, attention is stabilized and, then, neural plasticity can be triggered, by which the mental ability can be obtained.
