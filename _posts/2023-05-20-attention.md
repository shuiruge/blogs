title: Attention, Synaptic Plasticity, and Mind Monitoring

## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Attention Is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] Paying attention with intent sensitizes the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is attend. And ignoring, namely noticing without reacting by physical or mental deed, habituates the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is ignored. Importantly, both sensitization and habituation are chemically mediated. [^sensitization-and-habituation]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the section "Attentional Control Networks" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_.

  [^sensitization-and-habituation]: The word "sensitize" brings to mind that paying attention to a part of your body will enhance the feeling there, or that hearing becomes more sensitive when you are cued to pay attention to a certain type of voice. Contrarily, the word "habituate" reminds of the situation when you get used to the terrible smell of toilet, or to the background noise you do not care about.

    For the details of sensitization and habituation, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Stable Attention Triggers Synaptic Plasticity

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable; it is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural circuits that are currently attended become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized. In this situation, the chemical mediators cannot accumulate in synapses.

If, however, attention can be brought back to what is going to attend in the first place whenever it is taken away, then the chemical mediators will accumulate enough to trigger synaptic plasticity, leading to anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] The sensitization and the habituation then become long-lasting. In this way, we can plant what we want to cultivate, such as loving-kindness, and uproot what we want to eliminate, such as disturbing thoughts [^disturbing-thoughts].

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators that leads to sensitization are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within neurons. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to a long-term sensitization.

      TODO: explain for habituation.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^disturbing-thoughts]: Once what disturbs the mind is uprooted, long-lasting peacefulness is left.

## Monitoring the Mind Is the Only Ability Need for Stabilizing Attention

What happened when we try to stabilize our attention to some object? First, we have to know what is currently present in the mind at every moment. Only then can we realize if the mind has been distracted. If so, let go the distraction and focus on the object with intent again. That is all. So, there are four abilities employed in this process: the ability of monitoring the mind [^mind], of realizing distraction, of letting go distraction, and of focus with intent. But, not all these abilities are essential. In fact, if we can know what is currently present in the mind at every moment, then distraction can be realized in the first place. Without further development, letting go the distraction and focus with intent will be quite natural. So, when the first ability is gained, the others are fulfilled on their own. The unique ability we need for stabilizing our attention is the ability of monitoring the mind. [^universality]

  [^mind]: We use mind as an equivalent of consciousness.

  [^universality]: It is also the only ability that is independent of the object on which our attention is stabilized.

## Ability of Monitoring the Mind Is Obtained by Stabilizing Attention

To obtain the mental ability of knowing what is currently present in the mind at every moment with little effort, we have to focus our attention to be aware of what is currently present in the mind. From time to time, however, attention will slip away by its own. And we bring it back again and again, till it is temporally tamed to stay at being aware of what is currently present in the mind autonomously. In this way, attention is stabilized and, then, neural plasticity can be triggered, by which the mental ability can be obtained.

## Practice Should Be Gradual and Methodical

You may find breath constantly perceptible. So, it indicates that your attention has been slipped away if you cannot realize the current state of breath. Also, you may find that mental phenomena are more subtle and swift than physical phenomena. So, it is suggested to care more about the thoughts in the mind than other kinds of object. For example, intention is usually overlooked when we start to move or to talk.
