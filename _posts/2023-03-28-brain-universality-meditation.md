title: Modular Brain, Universal Module, and Meditation

## Modular Brain

In human brain, the unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. A _perceived object_ [^italics-convention] is a pack of processed information projected into consciousness from a module of the unconscious. It's projected so that other modules can receive the information, which is the only way that modules communicate with each other, and that objects in the inner and outer worlds can be conscious. [^modularity] After receiving the information, correlated modules are activated and uncorrelated are suppressed. Modules become _correlated_ if they have been activated together [^activated-together] many times. The higher a module is activated, the more probable it will project. Furthermore, if a module has projected a pack of processed information into consciousness, the others cannot project until the current passes away [^information-overlap]; and the consumption of the projected needs time, duration of which cannot be arbitrarily short, but finitely limited. [^brain-perception]

## Representation

Based on these facts, perceptive process can be represented by a temporal sequence like

    ⋯ → module A {module B, module C} → module B {module D, module E} → module E {⋯} → ⋯,

where each module occupies a time quantum in consciousness, and the modules in braces are the correlated.

## Practice

A beginner who performs a task tries hard to coordinate modules of the unconscious so that they work together to accomplish the task. Competing to occupy consciousness from other modules during the perceptive process frequently interrupts. This perceptive process is like

    ⋯ → module A {⋯} → intention of module B {module B} → module B → ⋯,

where the intention tries to trigger the subsequent module B. But, with repeated practice, module A and B become gradually correlated. In this situation, whenever the former projects, the later follows. The perceptive process now becomes

    ⋯ → module A {module B} → module B → ⋯,

where the intention is absent. This is what the practice results from the modular perspective.

### Question: Order in Correlation

Is the order of module irrelevant to the correlation? Say, if module A correlates with module B by practice

    ⋯ → module A → module B → ⋯,

will module B then triggers module A?

A possible answer is that module B triggers module A if and only if module A is not the predecessor of module B. That is,

    ⋯ → module A {module B} → module B {module C} → ⋯,

where module A is absent in the successors of module B.

## Habitual Response

The years have imprints on us. Many correlations in our brain have been formatted because of what's past. In many cases, perceptive processes are like

    ⋯ → module A {module B} → module B {module C} → module C {module D} → ⋯.

where the preceding module suppresses all but the successive. This is the habitual response.

## Universal Module

A _universal module_ is a module of the unconscious that is correlated with all other modules. It breaks habitual responses. Indeed, with a universal module, perceptive process becomes

    ⋯ → module A {universal module} → universal module {⋯} → module F {universal module} → ⋯,

where the "⋯" in braces indicates many modules that are correlated with the universal one. These modules are activated now, instead of suppressed as in the case without the universal module; and the next module that projects will be one of them, depending on the strength of activity. So, the habitual response breaks. Our brain is, then, reprogrammed.

## Meditation

_Meditation_ is the practice that trains a universal module. The task of meditation is

    module A → intention of universal module → universal module,

for any module. With repeated practice at every moment of perception, correlations between modules of perception and of the universal are built, so that the perceptive process becomes

    module A → universal module.

This is how meditation makes a module universal.

This universal module can be awareness of what's being perceived, perception of breath, etc., as long as it can be continuously activated in daily life.

[^italics-convention]: Throughout this note, italics is employed in two cases:

    - for books and articles, which are listed in the "References" section;
    - for defining proper nouns, usually at the place where they first appear in the text. Note that these words have different meanings than they do in everyday speech.

[^modularity]: A _module_, however, shall not be identified by a location in human brain, but is that which accomplishes the procession and projection, a step of perceptive process. It is either compound, of many interconnected parts of human brain, or elemental.

    Furthermore, a module can be a combination of many sub-modules, each accomplishing a more fundamental step, cooperating with each other through consciousness in due order, so that the total effect is the step accomplished by the combined. And this module, combined with some others, can form a super-module. This is an effective theory, remind us of the Kadanoff's renormalization group in physics. And, it's in this perspective that any step of perceptive process has a corresponding module that accomplishes it. A more fundamental step it is, a more underlying module it corresponds to.

[^activated-together]: When two modules are activated together, we mean they both project during a short period.

[^information-overlap]: This is plausible, since if two or more packs of processed information from different modules are projected into consciousness at the same time, they will overlap so that the information cannot be effectively received by other modules.

[^brain-perception]: These facts are abstractions of what's happening in human brain. Like all other abstractions, circles or squares for instance, the relevant skeletons are extracted, while the irrelevant details are neglected. Abstraction simplifies the situations, providing us a clearer perspective.

    But, for seeking the details, extensive and comprehensive experimental and theoretical illustrations, and even numerical simulations, can be found in the chapter "Theorizing Consciousness" of _Consciousness and the Brain_ and the references therein.
