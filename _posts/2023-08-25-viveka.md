## Viveka Is the Insight Knowledge of Discriminating Moments

Yogis and buddhists found that consciousness is not a continuum, but constitutes a series of indivisible temporal units, called moments. [^moments] It is like a movie made up of a series of frames. These moments are transient, leaving to us the illusion that consciousness is continuous. Viveka is the ability of discriminating these moments, realizing that a moment and the following are distinct, and that only after the falling of the preceding will a moment arise. [^viveka]

  [^moments]: For details, see the stanzas from 3.52 to 3.54 of _The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_, chapter 4 of _A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma_, and section "Insight Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away" of _Manual of Insight_.

  [^viveka]: Stanza 3.52 of _The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_ defines viveka and declares the path to viveka:

    > From samyama on the moment and its succession, there is knowledge born of discrimination.

    Here, "samyama" is the combination of concentration, meditation, and samadhi. And the "knowledge born of discrimination" is viveka.

    However, in many commentaries except for that by Vyasa, the discrimination is explained as that discriminating Atman from non-Atman, or Self from non-Self. In fact, in the following stanza (3.53), Patanjali explained that, based on this discrimination, things can be distinguished even though they share the same characters and position. As Heraclitus claimed, one could never step into the same river twice. And in the next stanza (3.55), Patanjali claimed that this ability will lead to the separation of Self and non-Self. So, it is confirmed that it is discriminating moments that is what Patanjali referred to, and that it is the result of this discrimination, instead of the discrimination itself, Self and non-Self are separated.

## Viveka Leads to Superlative Ability of Monitoring Mind

While applying viveka, consciousness is realized not as a "room" full of objects, but a series in which there is just one object at each moment. Thus **every** object that appears in consciousness can be realized. So, he who acquires viveka gains the superlative ability of monitoring the mind [^mind].

  [^mind]: We use the word mind as an equivalent of consciousness.

As discussed in a [previous note](2023-05-20-attention.md), the ability of monitoring the mind leads to controlled synaptic plasticity, by which we can plant what we want to cultivate and uproot what we want to eliminate. So, he who acquires viveka gains the ability of shaping his brain at will.

## Practice of Viveka Should Be Gradual and Methodical

To obtain a new skill, learning shall be gradual, starting at a simpler level, and increasing the difficulty only when the skill at the current level has been sufficiently practiced. So, the practice of viveka shall be gradually fulfilling the temporal series of objects in the mind with noting, until every moment can be realized.

Explicitly, it is better to begin practicing in an environment where interference is kept to a minimum. Noting whatever becomes prominent, such as distracting thoughts and bodily pains. If there is nothing conspicuous to note, fulfill the temporal series with noting the rising and falling of abdomen caused by breathing. Noting shall be concurrently following the appearance of the object to be noted. It is very helpful, especially in the early stage of practice, to label what is noted, not audibly, but in a gentle and relaxed way, using simple daily language like "thinking", "pain", "rising", and "falling". Also, it is better to limit bodily movement to a minimum; and when it becomes inevitable, the whole process shall be performed slowly, and be noted including the intention to move.

In the beginning, only coarse objects can be noted. But gradually, noting will become finer and finer; and more subtle objects in the temporal series can be realized on their own. When noting becomes fast and swift, more and more objects come into awareness; labeling all of them can be exhausted. In this situation, it is better to drop labels, but simply being aware of what is currently in the mind. [^Mahasi-method]

  [^Mahasi-method]: The method of practice analyzed in this section is consistent with the Mahasi method, which is described in his _Manual of Insight_, especially in its chapter 5. This should not be a surprise, but a confirmation of validity and rationality of the analysis here.
