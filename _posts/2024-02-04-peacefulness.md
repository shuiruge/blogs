## A Poem

As plastic as a wooden board,  
mind is craved by the departed.  
Dormant memories in subconscious.  
Woken up by similar situations.  

When a dormant memory is woken,  
a mind without focus is driven  
to do what have been done before.  
A process that is involuntary.  
The memory is deepened more.  

Focusing on single object,  
mind forbids the others.  
Memory keeps dormant,  
but not disappears.  
They patiently wait  
for the focus to relax.  

Focusing on each moment,  
mind is busy with perceiving. (TODO: describe this by a proper image.)  
No mind for anything else.  
Nor for a memory to arise.  
Similar situation turns to loosen  
the memory that would be woken.[^insight] [^viveka]  

  [^insight]: Focusing on each moment is the center theme of _Manual of Insight_.

  [^viveka]: In _Yoga Sutra of Patanjali_, this is described in stanza 3.52:

    > From samyama on the moment and its succession, there is knowledge born of discrimination.

    Here, "samyama" is the combination of concentration, meditation, and samadhi. And the "knowledge born of discrimination" is viveka.

No disturbance from subconscious,  
the mind goes back to peace.  
Like the surface of a lake.  
The wind has gone, stillness is left.[^example]  

  [^example]: For example, when we meet something that makes us angry, we feel angry. What makes us angry may not make a baby angry too. It makes us angry because of the dormant memory of us is woken up by it. Rationality will not help. We cannot control it with rationality since it sits in subconscious. Even worse, the emotion will trigger a series of thoughts, which in turn enlarge the emotion, as if pouring oil on the flames. We lost temper, even going mad. Our mind is greatly disturbed, even though it was peaceful seconds ago. The memories stored in subconscious are the sources of disturbance of peace. When they are uprooted, nothing will disturb the mind. Like the surface of a lake. The wind that troubles has gone, it goes back to be still naturally. The mind without being disturbed falls into peace on its own.
