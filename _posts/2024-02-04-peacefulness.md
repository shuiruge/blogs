## A Poem

As plastic as a wooden board,  
mind is craved by the departed.  
Dormant memories in subconscious.  
Woken up by similar situations.  

When a dormant memory is woken,  
a mind without focus is driven  
to do what have been done before.  
A process that is involuntary.  
The memory is deepened more.  

Focusing on single object,  
mind forbids the others.  
Memory keeps dormant,  
but not disappears.  
They patiently wait  
for the focus to relax.  

Focusing on each moment,  
mind is busy with perceiving  
those from six sense organs, [^six-sense-organs]  
like the hand dipped in stream.  
No mind for anything else.  
Nor for a memory to arise.  
Similar situation turns to loosen  
the memory that would be woken. [^mental-noting] [^viveka]  

No disturbance from subconscious,  
the mind goes back to peace.  
Like the surface of a lake.  
The wind has gone, stillness is left.  

  [^six-sense-organs]: Aristotle defined five senses: vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch, linked to specific sense organs in the body: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin respectively. Intuition is usually recognized as the sixth sense. These six sense organs are consist with the Buddhist cognition of sensory system, vividly named as "six sense doors": eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

  [^mental-noting]: While trying to know what is in your mind at the moment, you may be confused by the knowing. This is because you are not familiar with using your awareness, even though it is your innate ability. It may be found helpful to make a mental label on what is in your mind at the moment, not audibly, but in a gentle and relaxed way, using simple daily language. For example, when you clearly hear sounds, label as "hearing"; when you feel painful, label as "pain"; and when it is found that you are thinking, label as "thinking". With concrete mental labels, it is guaranteed that you have known what was in your mind at that moment. But be caution that this trick is just a tool that gives you some familiarity with using awareness. It is like using a finger to point out the moon. The figure is not the moon itself. Mental labeling is not awareness too. In fact, awareness is innate, light, and swift, while mental labeling is factitious, heavy, and delayed. So, remove the mental labels if your confusion have ceased, just be aware.

    For the details of this mental noting technique, see chapter 5 of _Manual of Insight_. As explained in the chapter, focusing mind on each moment is the center theme of Theravada Buddhism. From it arises impermanence. Then from impermanence, suffering and non-self arise successively.

  [^viveka]: Focusing mind on each moment is also a key of _The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali_, in which it is called "viveka", described in stanza 3.52:

    > From samyama on the moment and its succession, there is knowledge born of discrimination.

    The "samyama" is the combination of concentration, meditation, and one-pointedness. The "knowledge born of discrimination" is viveka.

## Example

For example, when we meet something that makes us angry, we feel angry. What makes us angry may not make a baby angry too. It makes us angry because of the dormant memory of us is woken up by it. We cannot control it with rationality since it sits in subconscious. Even worse, the emotion will trigger a series of thoughts, which in turn enlarge the emotion, as if pouring oil on the flames. We lost temper, even going mad. Our mind is greatly disturbed, even though it was peaceful seconds ago. The memories stored in subconscious are the sources of disturbance of peace. When they are uprooted, nothing will disturb the mind. Like the surface of a lake. The wind that troubles has gone, it goes back to be still naturally. The mind without being disturbed falls into peace on its own.
