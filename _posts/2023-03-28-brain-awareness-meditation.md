## Modular Brain

### The Perceptive Process

In human brain, the unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. A _perceived object_ [^italics-convention] is a pack of processed information projected into consciousness from a module of the unconscious. It's projected so that other modules can receive the information, which is the only way that modules communicate with each other, and that objects in the inner and outer worlds can be perceived. [^modularity] Furthermore, if a module has projected a pack of processed information into consciousness, the others cannot project until the current passes away [^information-overlap]; and the consumption of the projected needs time, duration of which cannot be arbitrarily short, but finitely limited. [^brain-perception] So, the _perceptive process_ must be a temporal sequence like

    ⋯ → perceived object A → perceived object B → perceived object C → ⋯,

during which each perceived object occupies a time quantum in consciousness; and patterns like

    ⋯ → perceived object A + perceived object B + perceived object C → ⋯,

where the perceived objects A, B, and C occupy a single time quantum, are excluded.

### Trigger a Module

A beginner who performs a task tries hard to coordinate modules of the unconscious so that they work together to accomplish the task. Competing to occupy consciousness from other modules during the perceptive process frequently interrupts. This perceptive process is like [^module]

    ⋯ → (module A) → (intention) → (module B) → ⋯,

where the intention triggers the subsequent module B. But, with repeated practice, module A and B are gradually connected altogether: whenever the former projects, the later follows. The perceptive process now becomes

    ⋯ → (module A) → (module B) → ⋯,

where the intention is absent. This is what the practice results from the modular perspective.

### Self-Learning

Modules of the unconscious learn from what's realized on their own. They filter the relevant, extract patterns, and evolve to simulate better. This is how the human brain learns.

Question: What do you mean by "from what's realized"? In fact, they received all the information projected into the consciousness. So, there should be nothing dismissed. But why awareness is essential for learning now?

## Continuous Awareness

If something relevant [^what-is-relevant] goes unnoticed, then either the brain won't learn, or the learned brain is biased since the materials are partial. So, self-learning becomes the most efficient if and only if our brain can be aware of [^be-aware-of] all what's being perceived during the perceptive process, [^Mahasi] for which the perceptive process is

    ⋯ → perceived object A → aware of A → perceived object B → aware of B → ⋯,

where the terms "aware of A" and "aware of B" are packs of information projected from _awareness_, a module of the unconscious that faithfully tells the others what's happening in consciousness. [^awareness] During a time quantum, once awareness arises, other objects will be excluded. So, all that are perceived are now realized.

## Meditative Practice

_Meditative practice_ is the methodical practice aiming to reinforce our awareness to be continuous. The task of meditative practice is

    perceived object A → intent to be aware → aware of A,

for any perceived object. [^Tejaniya] With repeated practice at every moment of perception, connection between modules of perceptions and of awareness are built, so that a perception will trigger awareness unconsciously, that is,

    perceived object A → aware of A.

This is how meditative practice makes awareness continuous. With repeated practice, awareness closely follows what's being perceived. No matter what you are doing, attending to the objects to be noticed, awareness appears as if falling upon these objects, as if striking at them, without a break. In this situation, our brain won't miss anything that comes to it; and the details of things are revealed on their own.

## FAQ

### Relation between Meditative Practice and Concentration

When we concentrate on something, our attention is continuously kept on it without digression. Meditative practice is a kind of concentration, but the thing we concentrated on is one and unique. That is, concentrating on awareness of all what's being perceived.

### Mental Label Technique

At the beginning stage of meditative practice, to guarantee awareness, mental labeling what's being perceived will be helpful. But this technique is not essential; and if you feel uncomfortable with it, simply keep awareness without any mental label. Being aware is what is essential.

### What is Nibbana

When awareness becomes extremely strong so that the perceptive process is constantly occupied by what is projected only from the single awareness, we experience the Nibbana. In this situation, all but awareness are excluded from consciousness.

[^modularity]: A _module_, however, shall not be identified by a location in human brain, but is that which accomplishes the procession and projection, a step of perceptive process. It is either compound, of many interconnected parts of human brain, or elemental.

    Furthermore, a module can be a combination of many sub-modules, each accomplishing a more fundamental step, cooperating with each other through consciousness in due order, so that the total effect is the step accomplished by the combined. And this module, combined with some others, can form a super-module. This is an effective theory, remind us of the Kadanoff's renormalization group in physics. And, it's in this perspective that any step of perceptive process has a corresponding module that accomplishes it. A more fundamental step it is, a more underlying module it corresponds to.

[^information-overlap]: This is plausible, since if two or more packs of processed information from different modules are projected into consciousness at the same time, they will overlap so that the information cannot be effectively received by other modules.

[^brain-perception]: These facts are abstractions of what's happening in human brain. Like all other abstractions, circles or squares for instance, the relevant skeletons are extracted, while the irrelevant details are neglected. Abstraction simplifies the situations, providing us a clearer perspective.

    But, for seeking the details, extensive and comprehensive experimental and theoretical illustrations, and even numerical simulations, can be found in the chapter "Theorizing Consciousness" of _Consciousness and the Brain_ and the references therein. And for the modularity and concurrency of the unconscious, see also the chapter "Fathoming Unconscious Depths" of the same book.

[^module]: The perceptive process can be viewed from two perspectives: that of perceived objects, and that of modules. So, an item of the perceptive process indicates either a perceived object, or a module that projects the perceived object if in parentheses. So, we have

    ⋯ → perceived object A → (module B) → perceived object C → (module D) → ⋯.

[^what-is-relevant]: Notice that it's the learned brain that can figure out what's relevant. Before learning, everything that is perceived has the potential to be relevant.

[^be-aware-of]: When we are aware of something, we simply know it, realizing its appearance, as if saying "Ah! It comes". It's effortless.

[^Mahasi]: We can only perceive things through our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, where body involves movements and feelings, and mind involves emotions and thoughts. These six sense organs are, thus, called the _six sense doors_.

    In the chapter “Practical Instructions” of _Manual of Insight_, Mahasi Sayadaw claimed that

    > True insight practice is an awareness of all of the mental and physical phenomena that constantly arise at the six sense doors.

[^awareness]: From the modular perspective, we know that, whenever something is perceived, there must be a module by whom information is projected into consciousness. So too it is for perceiving what's being perceived; and the module that accomplishes this is awareness.

    (Remark that whether awareness is a single module or multiple is not ensured. It may be a collection of modules, each for a sense organ.)

[^Tejaniya]: At the end of _When Awareness Becomes Natural_, Sayadaw U Tejaniya declared that

    > Your work is to be gently aware of what is being perceived at all your sense doors in this moment. That is all!
