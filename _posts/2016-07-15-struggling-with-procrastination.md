This note summarizes the material in a MOOC, LHTL.

## The causation of procrastination

The unwillingness of doing a task evokes a *pain* in your brain, in the region of your brain where a pain usually emerges. This slides you to other things you're temporally interested in so as to cease this pain. This, then, makes procrastination.

## Methods of struggling with procrastination

### Focusing on process, instead of product. 

The unwillingness of doing a task is, usually, realizing it's hard to be accomplished. Verily, by this realization we focus on the product of this task, instead of its process. Precisely, it means that *divide the whole task into sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks; and then focus on them one by one*. Therein, accomplishment of each sub-task is no longer hard, so that the causation of procrastination vanishes.

Practically, you can list out what you will do tomorrow before sleeping, detailed in each step of every task.

### Allocate your willpower unto procrastination cues.

Exhaust your willpower in struggling with procrastination is far from wise, since it's valuable. The only place of allocating your willpower is watching out procrastination cues, such as "I'm suffering from tension, with which I cannot studying well. So, it's time to watch a movie".

### Work out the hardest task in the morning.

Well, you know the reason if you're procrastinating.

## Finally,

May the FSM be with your great struggling with procrastination.
