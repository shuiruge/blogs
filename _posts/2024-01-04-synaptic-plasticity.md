## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

## Anticipation Modulates Neural Pathway

_Anticipation_ is an intention to response to a kind of stimuli by a specific behavior. [^anticipation] To do so, anticipation modulates the network by facilitating the synapses along a neural pathway that mediates the behavior. In this way, it is ensured that, when stimulated, it is the neural pathway which mediates the behavior rather than any other that is activated. Importantly, **modulation of neural pathway is chemically mediated**. [^modulation]

  [^anticipation]: Throughout this note, we use the word "anticipation" in this narrow sense. For example, we can anticipate sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath, where the stimuli come from air striking the nasal cavity and the behavior is sensing the nasal sensation. We can also anticipate feeling more and more relaxed as the clock ticks, where the stimuli come from the clock ticks and the behavior is active relaxation. When practicing piano, the stimuli come from hearing a chord and the behavior is playing the successive chord. Notice that anticipation is independent of the appearance of the stimuli; it is an intention, a mental activity.

  [^modulation]: There are two kinds of receptors on synapses. One is ionotropic receptor, which _mediates_ behaviors by propagating electrical signals. The other is metabotropic receptor, which _modulates_ behaviors by modifying the strength of synapses. Metabotropic receptor, when activated, mobilizes chemical mediators in the synapse to facilitate the release or/and the reception of neurotransmitters. For details, see chapter 11 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

      Stimulating a neuron may activate many neural pathways that are successively connected to the neuron. To selectively activate a neural pathway among the rest, it is essential to facilitate the synapses along the neural pathway, so as to get sufficient probability of activation. The metabotropic receptors on those synapses have to be activated.

      For example, when we anticipate seeing red objects, the neural pathway that responsible for detecting red color is facilitated, so that whenever we see an object, this neural pathway has much higher probability of being activated, so that we can detect red object correctly but missing the objects with other colors. The famous "invisible gorilla" experiment made by Daniel Simons is another example.

## Sustained Anticipation Triggers Long-Lasting Synaptic Plasticity

**If an anticipation can be sustained, so is the modulation, the chemical mediators in the synapses along the neural pathway will keep accumulating.** It does not take long for the concentrations to become so high as to trigger an intense synaptic plasticity, leading to long-lasting anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] So, we can plant what we want to cultivate, or uproot what we want to eliminate, by simply sustaining a proper anticipation. [^hypnosis]

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within the synapses. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to an anatomical change in the synapses.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^hypnosis]: In hypnosis, the hypnotic takes the suggestion from the hypnotist, and focuses his mind on it. It is based on the same principle, where the suggestion plays the role of anticipation.

## Persistent Introspection Sustains Anticipation

But, mind has an inherent tendency to wander around. Before long, mind slips away and anticipation is lost. So, we have to persistently watch the mind so as to detect when it slips and to bring it back in time. In this way, anticipation is sustained. [^breath-example]

  [^breath-example]: Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to sustained the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath. Usually, we do not feel the nasal sensation when air strikes the nasal cavity. But when we anticipate like "sense the nasal sensation when in/out-breathe" or "observe the strength of the inspiration/expiration", it is felt immediately that the nasal sensation caused by breathing stands out from the blurry background of mind. This is because the synapses along the neural pathway that mediates the behavior of sensing the nasal sensation are facilitated, for ensuring that, when air strikes the nasal cavity, it is this neural pathway, rather than any other that succeeds to the stimuli by air striking, that is activated. This modulation is mediated by the chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway. With sustained effort of anticipating, the feeling comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. Details reveal themselves. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. This is the effect of accumulation of the chemical mediators. But, it will not last long. The mind is constantly searching for something attractive, something new. When the mind slips away, if it is detected in time, we bring the mind back to the anticipation again. Then, nothing is really interrupted and the accumulation goes on. Otherwise, the mind goes astray and soon the chemical mediators lose their concentrations. When the anticipation can be sustained, nothing stops the chemical mediators accumulating. Synaptic plasticity is then triggered in an extreme way. It is like forming highly emotional memory: long-lasting changes are made in a period that is short.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath alone, but for any anticipation, since the principle behind is the same.
