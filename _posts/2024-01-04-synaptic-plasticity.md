## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

## Suggestion Modulates Neural Pathway

_Suggestion_ [^italic] is an intention to response to a kind of stimuli by a specific behavior. To do so, suggestion modulates the network by facilitating the synapses along a neural pathway that mediates the behavior. In this way, it is ensured that, when the leading neurons are stimulated, it is the neural pathway that mediates the behavior rather than any other that is activated. Importantly, **modulation of neural pathway is chemically mediated**. [^modulation]

  [^italic]: Throughout this note, italic font indicates either definition or proper noun.

  [^modulation]: There are two kinds of receptors on synapses. One is ionotropic receptor, which _mediates_ behaviors by propagating electrical signals. The other is metabotropic receptor, which _modulates_ behaviors by modifying the strength of synapses. Metabotropic receptor, when activated, mobilizes chemical mediators in the synapse to facilitate the release or/and the reception of neurotransmitters. For details, see chapter 11 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

      Stimulating a neuron may activate many neural pathways that are successively connected to the neuron. To selectively activate a neural pathway among the rest, it is essential to facilitate the synapses along the neural pathway, so as to get sufficient probability of activation. The metabotropic receptors on those synapses have to be activated.

      For example, when we are suggested to take care of red objects, the neural pathway that responsible for detecting red color is facilitated, so that whenever we see an object, this neural pathway has much higher probability of being activated, so that we can detect red object correctly but missing the objects with other colors. The famous "invisible gorilla" experiment made by Daniel Simons is another example.

## Sustained Suggestion Triggers Long-Lasting Synaptic Plasticity

**If a suggestion can be sustained, so is the modulation, the chemical mediators in the synapses along the neural pathway will keep accumulating.** It does not take long for the concentrations to become so high as to trigger an intense synaptic plasticity, leading to long-lasting anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] So, we can plant what we want to cultivate, or uproot what we want to eliminate, by simply sustaining a proper suggestion. [^hypnosis]

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within the synapses. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to an anatomical change in the synapses.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^hypnosis]: In hypnosis, the hypnotic takes the suggestion from the hypnotist, and focuses his mind on it. It is based on the same principle. And it is by this analogy, we employed the word "suggestion".

## Persistent Introspection Sustains Suggestion

But, mind has an inherent tendency to wander around. Before long, mind slips away and suggestion is lost. So, we have to persistently watch the mind so as to detect when it slips and to bring it back in time. In this way, suggestion is sustained. [^breath-example]

  [^breath-example]: Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to sustained the suggestion of sensing the nasal sensation of breath. After suggesting, it is felt immediately that the nasal sensation stands out from the blurry background of mind. The corresponding neural pathways is modulated. With sustained effort of suggesting, it then comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. Details reveal themselves. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. This is the effect of the accumulation of chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway. But, it will not last long. The mind is constantly searching for something attractive, something else. When the mind slips away, if it is detected in time, we bring the mind back to the suggestion again. Then, nothing is really interrupted and the accumulation goes on. Otherwise, the mind goes astray and soon the chemical mediators lose their concentrations. When the suggestion can be sustained, nothing stops the chemical mediators accumulating. Synaptic plasticity is then triggered in an extreme way. It is like forming highly emotional memory. Long-lasting changes are made in a period that is short.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the suggestion of sensing the nasal sensation of breath alone, but for any suggestion that modulates a neural pathway, since the principle behind is the same.
