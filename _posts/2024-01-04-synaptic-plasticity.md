## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: For the details of human brain as modularized network, see chapter 1 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Intention Modulates Neural Pathway

Intention modulates the behavior of the network. It facilitates the synapses along a neural pathway in the network. For example, an intention of sensing the right toes makes the feeling of toes stand out from darkness immediately. The is the effect of modulating the neural pathway that senses the toes. Importantly, **modulation of neural pathway is chemical mediated**. [^modulation]

  [^modulation]: TODO: explain how modulation is chmeical mediated.

## Sustained Intention Triggers Long-Lasting Synaptic Plasticity

**If an intention can be sustained, so is the modulation, the chemical mediators in the synapses along the neural pathway will keep accumulating.** It does not take long for the concentrations to become so high as to trigger an intense synaptic plasticity, leading to long-lasting anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] So, we can plant what we want to cultivate, or uproot what we want to eliminate, by simply sustaining a proper intention. [^hypnosis]

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within the synapses. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to an anatomical change in the synapses.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^hypnosis]: In hypnosis, the hypnotic takes the suggestion from the hypnotist, and focuses his mind on it. This suggestion plays the role of intention. Maybe hypnosis is based on the same principle.

## Persistent Introspection Sustains Intention

But, mind has an inherent tendency to wander around. Before long, mind slips away and intention is lost. So, we have to persistently watch the mind so as to detect when it slips and to bring it back in time. In this way, intention is sustained. [^breath-example]

  [^breath-example]: Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to sustained the intention of sensing the nasal sensation of breath. After making the intention, it is felt immediately that the nasal sensation stands out from the blurry background of mind. The corresponding neural pathways is modulated. With sustained effort of making intention, it then comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. Details reveal themselves. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. This is the effect of the accumulation of chemical mediators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway. But, it will not last long. The mind is constantly searching for something attractive, something else. When the mind slips away, if it is detected in time, we bring the mind back to the intention again. Then, nothing is really interrupted and the accumulation goes on. Otherwise, the mind goes astray and soon the chemical mediators lose their concentrations. When the intention can be sustained, nothing stops the chemical mediators accumulating. Synaptic plasticity is then triggered in an extreme way. It is like forming highly emotional memory. Long-lasting changes are made in a period that is short.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the intention of sensing the nasal sensation of breath alone, but for any intention that modulates a neural pathway, since the principle behind is the same.
