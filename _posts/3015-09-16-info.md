COI

This is the INFO of my blog.

I was a student studying astrophysics, cosmology. I am learning Sanskrit, so as to read _Gita_.

I'm a linux user. I also use a lisp-like language, _Mathematica_. I am learning SICP, via Python, the note of which taken by me is at [here](https://github.com/shuiruge/learning-sicp).

I usually write blogs in Chinese, but sometimes in English.
