I am in Deqin, Yunnan, surrounded by mountains.

Deqin, as a small town, located deep in the valley of mountains, on the top of which smeared snow and clouds. Houses around the town are built on the place relatively flat (slope less than 30 degree). Frozen wind delivers the songs by cows and birds, and the smell bursting from trees and grass. The mountains, with its sharp edges sticking into the blue sky (and clouds if cloudy, then hidden), covered by different colors.

It bursts you if stand in the sun light, out of which it freezes you from inside. Dry wind takes your temperature and the dizzying in your mind. Even walking is hard, breathing deep and slow.
