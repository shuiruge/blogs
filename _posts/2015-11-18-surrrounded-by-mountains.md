title: Surrounded by Mountains
---

I am in Deqin, Yunnan, surrounded by mountains.

Deqin, as a small town, located deep in the valley of mountains, on the top of which smeared snow and clouds. Houses around the town are built on the place relatively flat (slope less than 30 degree). Frozen wind delivers the songs by cows and birds, the smell bursting from trees and grass. 


(To be continued.)
