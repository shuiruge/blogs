## Mindfulness[^convention]

When something is perceived, it affects us.[^be-perceived-and-affected] The more it affects us, the more prominent it is perceived.

We can only perceive things through our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.[^body-and-mind] These six sense organs are, thus, called the _six sense doors_.[^doors]

**_Mindfulness_ is the attention that can be aware of[^be-aware-of] what is being perceived at all the six sense doors in every moment.**[^Tejaniya] It's effortless, spacious, and sharp. It effectively collects information without missing anything that affects us; and with the integrated perspective, _insight_ comes to arise.[^insight]

## Meditation

**_Meditation_ is the progressive practice aiming to train the attention to become mindful.**

The article [Satipaṭṭhāna Vipassāna](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/wheel370.html) by Mahāsi Sayādaw sufficiently illustrates how meditation is performed in detail. Briefly, meditation practice rests us in a constant state of observation or noticing on what is prominently perceived at the six sense doors. With this, our attention are concentrated on nothing but the observation. Also with this constant state, attention gains constant training, becoming shaper and shaper naturally.

## FAQ

### Relations between Mindfulness and Concentration

When we concentrate on something, our attention is constantly kept on it without digression. Mindfulness is a kind of concentration, but the thing we concentrated on is one and unique. That is, concentrating on awareness of what is being perceived at all the six sense doors.

### Main obstacles during meditation

There are two main obstacles during meditation practice. The first is your will. Once you determine to rest in the position of observation or noticing, the second main obstacles may raise, which is stray thoughts. Because the mind-door is much closer to us than any other sense doors, it's much easier to be unaware of the thoughts perceived at the mind-door than, e.g., to be unaware of the sounds perceived at ear-door, even though both are prominent. Also, thoughts are autonomous and active. So, they keep raising but we are unaware. We stray into them, as if thinking is I.

### What's Insight and Why it Raises

Human brain is a great simulator. Indeed, it can effortlessly simulate a world and a whole story therein, which we call dream.[^brain-capability] It, thus, can effectively learn conditional relationships, which predict what will happen if somethings are taken, that is, simulations of reality. This fact forms the basis of insight arising. And insight is the learned brain.

However, the brain can learn if and only if it knows what has been perceived, both inside and outside, and the results in reality. So, mindfulness is the essential and sufficient condition of insight arising.

#### Example

Suppose you are a first year graduate student. You found an interesting academic paper, and started reading. At first, you read slowly and carefully, word by word. Several pages later, you began reading faster, since you found you cannot understand what the authors wrote. This is easy to understand. At first, we will not encounter much unfamiliar concepts. But the more content you have read, the more unfamiliar concepts will you meet. You will feel confused once it exceeds a threshold. In this situation, it's a waste of time to continue reading. However, this is not that obvious for a first year graduate student. Finally, late at night, we gave up.

If you were mindful, you would be aware of the body-mind process, the impatience, the thoughts of complaint, your scratching of head. It's a hint of re-considering the strategy, of re-evaluating the value of this paper. In the end, the brain would learn this. In the next time, you would be more experienced and know when to pause and adjust.

However, if you were trapped in the anxious feeling, or in the complaints, you would not be aware of what's going on in your body and mind. In this situation, the brain wouldn't learn. And in the next time, you would repeat this failure.

[^convention]: Use italics for proper nouns when they first appear in the text. These words have different meanings than they do in everyday speech.

[^be-perceived-and-affected]: Indeed, when a sound is perceived, we become capable of thinking about the sound; an intention to walk makes the body start walking; and walking leads to a constant changing of posture. Contrarily, when the mind is highly concentrated, so that sound cannot be perceived, it leaves no effect on us.

[^body-and-mind]: Body involves movements and feelings. And mind involves emotions and thoughts. They are more broad and more subtle than the other sense organs.

[^doors]: As in [_The Progress of Insight_](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html#fn-6), Nyanaponika Thera noted,

    > "Door" is a figurative expression for the sense organs (which, including the mind, are sixfold), because they provide, as it were, the access to the world of objects.

[^be-aware-of]: When we are aware of something, we simply know it, realizing its appearance, as if saying "Ah! It comes". It's effortless. A more rigorous definition is provided in the book _The Heart of Buddhist Meditation_, where Nyanaponika Thera named it as _Bare Attention_:

    > Bare Attention is the clear and single-minded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us, at the successive moments of perception. It is called ‘bare’, because it attends just to the bare facts of a perception as presented either through the five physical senses or through the mind which, for Buddhist thought, constitutes the sixth sense. When attending to that sixfold sense impression, attention or mindfulness is kept to a bare registering of the facts observed without reacting to them by deed, speech or by mental comment which may be one of self-reference (like, dislike, etc.), judgement or reflection. If during the time, short or long, given to the practice of Bare Attention, any such comments arise in one's mind, they themselves are made objects of Bare Attention, and are neither repudiated nor pursued, but are dismissed, after a brief mental note has been made of them.

    Indeed, the comments are, by themselves, objects in the mind-door.

[^Tejaniya]: At the end of the book _When Awareness Becomes Natural_, Sayādaw U Tejaniya provided a concise declaration:

    > Your work is to be gently aware of what is being perceived at all your sense doors in this moment. That is all!

[^brain-capability]: The capability of human brain has been discussed by François Roustang in his book _What is Hypnosis?_. TODO: which chapter?
