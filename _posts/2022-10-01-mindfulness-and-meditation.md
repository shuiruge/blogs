## Mindfulness

All things are perceived through the six sense organs, called the _six sense doors_. They are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.[^door]

When something is perceived, it affects[^affect] us. [^be-perceived] The more it affects us, the more prominent it is perceived. When something is perceived but is unaware of, it is _hindered_. In this situation, we are affected by what is unaware of.

**_Mindfulness_ is the attention that can be aware of what is being perceived at all the six sense doors in every moment.**[^Tejaniya] It is effortless, spacious, and sharp, effectively collecting information with nothing hindered, based on which insight[^insight] comes to arise.[^by-product]

## Meditation

**_Meditation_ is the progressive practice aiming to train the attention to become mindful.**

The article [Satipaṭṭhāna Vipassāna](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/wheel370.html) by by Mahāsi Sayādaw sufficiently illustrates how meditation is performed in detail.

## FAQ

### Comparing with Concentration

_Concentration_ is the attention that is extremely focused on some selected objects. It locks the mind, reducing the things perceived through the six sense doors. But it also reduces the raising of insight.

[^door]: As in [_The Progress of Insight_](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html#fn-6), Nyanaponika Thera noted,

    > "Door" is a figurative expression for the sense organs (which, including the mind, are sixfold), because they provide, as it were, the access to the world of objects.

[^affect]: When something affects us, it transits us into a new body-mind state.

[^be-perceived]: Indeed, when a sound is perceived, claiming that we heard nothing will be a lie; and an intention to walk makes the body start walking. Contrarily, when the mind is highly concentrated, so that sound cannot be perceived, it leaves no effect on us.

[^Tejaniya]: At the end of the book _When Awareness Becomes Natural_, Sayādaw U Tejaniya provided a concise declaration:

    > Your work is to be gently aware of what is being perceived at all your sense doors in this moment. That is all!

[^insight]: Or say, wisdom. It is the penetration into the things happening.

[^by-product]: It's also essential for rational thinking and action. But this is a by-product.
