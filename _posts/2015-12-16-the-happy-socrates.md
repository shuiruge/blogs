title: The Happy Socrates
---


Rather than from the altitude of events, from their gradient comes the happiness. This point cannot be more crucial, since it is the road to happiness.

This is the ascetic Socrates, to whom every usual waving of events bursts happiness out. But the same waving  to profligate.

So, Socrates is of happiness forsooth. He *creates* suffering, at the same time happiness.


PS: We are human; and as human we are rooted deep into the Nature of it, that is, the Stockholm syndrome. As a reason, behind suffering raises happiness.
