## Samādhi Triggers Controlled Neural Plasticity

When attention is focused on an object, the neural circuits that is relevant to the object are excited while the others are inhibited.

If the attention can be voluntarily controlled so that it steadily attends to an object for any period of time, then the corresponding neural mediators, being either excitatory or inhibitory, will accumulate in neurons. This triggers neural plasticity, leading to anatomical changes in synapses. [^neural-plasticity-materials]

  [^neural-plasticity-materials]: The neural mediators are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within neurons. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. For details and how this was found, see the book _In Search of Memory_ by Eric Kandel. TODO: add more academic references.

_Sam̄adhi_ is the ability by which attention is voluntarily controlled. It triggers controlled neural plasticity in the most direct way.

## Impression Is Stable Pattern of Cerebral Activity

When a pattern of activation of neural circuits is repeated enough times, it will finally become stabilized and automatic, an _impression_ is then formed. For instance, whenever happen to see something `A`, some emotion `B` then must raise, and then some thought `C`, and then some action `D`. So, the sequence `A → B → C → D` is stable and automatic.

Impression triggers the cerebral activity that mediates a sequence of emotion, thought, and action. And the cerebral activity in turn strengthens the impression. This leads to a circulation that impression strengthens itself.

Some impressions are accumulated during our life, and some are inborn.

## Source of Suffering Is Unwholesome Impressions

Impression can either be wholesome or unwholesome. _Wholesome impression_ is that which leads to inner coherence. And _unwholesome impression_ is that which leads to inner chaos.

_Yoga Sutra_ declared that the source of suffering and being unpeaceful is unwholesome impressions.

## Yoga Trains Sam̄adhi, Eliminates Unwholesome Impressions, and Cultivates Wholesome Ones

_Yoga_ is the path to sam̄adhi. It further, with the aid of sam̄adhi, eliminates unwholesome impressions and cultivates wholesome impressions.
