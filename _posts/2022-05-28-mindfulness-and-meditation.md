# Mindfulness and Meditation

本文意在于给予 mindfulness 和 meditation 明确的定义，阐明其动机，并从原理上说明如何实践。

## 定义

- Mindfulness：即良知[^nwit]，即性光[^light]，即 sati[^sati]。
- Meditation：即致良知，即回光守中，即 satipaṭṭhāna，也就是保持 sati 的技术。

[^nwit]: 《孟子》，尽心篇：

    > 人之所不学而能者，其良能也；所不虑而知者，其良知也。

[^light]: 《太乙金华宗旨》，性光识光第十：

    > 凡人視物，任眼一照去，不及分別，此為性光，如鏡之無心而照也，如水之無心而鑒也。少刻即為「識光」，以其分別也。

[^sati]: 《The Heart of Buddhist Meditation》，第一章：

    > If a sense object exercises a stimulus that is sufficiently strong, attention is roused in its basic form as an initial ‘taking notice’ of the object, as the first ‘turning towards’ it. [……] From this first phase of the perceptual process naturally only a very general and indistinct picture of the object results. If there is any further interest in the object, or if its impact on the senses is sufficiently strong, closer attention will be directed towards details. The attention, then, will dwell not only on the various characteristics of the object, but also on its relationship to the observer This will enable the mind to compare the present perception with similar ones recollected from the past, and, in that way, a coordination of experience will be possible. This stage marks a very important step in mental development, called in psychology associative thinking. It also shows us the close and constant connection between the functions of memory and attention (or mindfulness), and will thereby explain why in Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures, both these mental functions are expressed by the one word sati. Without memory, attention towards an object would furnish merely isolated facts, as it is the case with most of the perceptions of animals.

### 举例

比如你看到路上有老人摔倒，你的本能驱使你想要去扶起他。因为最近听说了不少新闻报道，你的脑海中自然地升起会被讹钱的念头（associative memory）。这些都是 mindfulness。如果这时，你紧跟着去思索会被讹钱的事（directed thoughts），就不再是 mindfulness 了。但如果任由这个念头升起，而不随着它思索，或者放开思索的力气，便又是 mindfulness 了。

## 动机

Mindfulness 通常是转瞬即逝的，有必要保持 mindfulness。为什么需要保持 mindfulness？

我们的想法（directed thoughts）常常是有不可控且有蔽的（biased）。后天形成的习惯性反应、情绪的影响、先入为主的成见，自发且不被察觉，所以是不可控的；它们使我们在尚未充分了解事物的时候，过早地做出判断和行动，错过真正有价值的想法，所以是有蔽的。

所以，必须要保持 mindfulness，以摆脱不可控且有蔽的想法（directed thoughts），为周全的思考和合理的行动提供必要条件。这就是 meditation。

## Meditation 如何做

觉知（conscious access）[^conscious-access]如光一般：凡它所照到的地方，那个地方便明亮起来，变得清晰，同时其它地方暗下来，变得模糊。它标志了意识的作用范围。

[^conscious-access]: 《Consciousness and the Brain》，第一章：

    > At any given time, a massive flow of sensory stimulation reaches our senses, but our conscious mind seems to gain access to only a very small amount of it. Every morning as I drive to work, I pass the same houses without ever noticing the color of their roof or the number of their windows. As I sit at my desk and concentrate on writing this book, my retina is bombarded with information about the surrounding objects, photographs, and paintings, their shapes and colors. Simultaneously, my ears are stirred with music, birdsong, noise from the neighbors—and yet all these distracting bits remain in the unconscious background while I focus on writing.
    >
    > Conscious access is, at once, extraordinarily open and inordinately selective. Its potential repertoire is vast. At any given moment, with a switch of my attention, I can become conscious of a color, a scent, a sound, a lost memory, a feeling, a strategy, an error—or even the multiple meanings of the word consciousness. If I make a blunder, I may even become self-conscious—which means that my emotions, strategies, errors, and regrets will enter my conscious mind. At any moment, however, the actual repertoire of consciousness is dramatically limited. We are fundamentally reduced to just about one conscious thought at a time (although a single thought can be a substantial “chunk” with several subcomponents, as when we ponder the meaning of a sentence).

    >
    > Because of its limited capacity, consciousness must withdraw from one item in order to gain access to another. Stop reading for a second, and notice the position of your legs; perhaps you feel a pressure here or a pain there. This perception is now conscious. But a second earlier it was preconscious—accessible but not accessed, it lay dormant amid the vast repository of unconscious states. It did not necessarily remain unprocessed: you constantly adjust your posture unconsciously in response to such bodily signals. However, conscious access made it available to your mind—all at once, it became accessible to your language system and to many other processes of memory, attention, intention, and planning. It is precisely that switch from preconscious to conscious, suddenly letting a piece of information into awareness. Exactly what happens then is the question that I hope to clarify in this book: the brain mechanisms of conscious access[^brain-mechanism].

[^brain-mechanism]: 《Consciousness and the Brain》，第四章：

    > By looking closer at our recordings, we discover that the evolution of the P3 wave also explains why our participants failed to see the target word. In our experiment, there were in fact two P3 waves. The first P3 was evoked by the initial string of letters, which served to distract attention and was always consciously perceived. The second was elicited by the target word when it was seen. Fascinatingly, there was a systematic trade-off between these two events. Whenever the first P3 wave was large and long, the second one was much more likely to be absent—and those were precisely the trials on which the target was likely to be missed. Conscious access thus operated as a push-and-pull system: whenever the brain was occupied for a long time by the first string, as indexed by a long P3 wave, it could not simultaneously attend to the second word. Consciousness of one seemed to exclude consciousness of the other.
    >
    > René Descartes would have been delighted; he was the first to note that “we cannot be very attentive to several things at once,” a limitation of consciousness that he attributed to the simple mechanical fact that the pineal gland could lean to only one side at a time. Leaving aside this discredited brain localization, Descartes was right: our conscious brain cannot experience two ignitions at once and lets us perceive only a single conscious “chunk” at a given time. Whenever the prefrontal and parietal lobes are jointly engaged in processing a first stimulus, they cannot simultaneously reengage toward a second one. The very act of concentrating on the first item often prevents us from perceiving the second. Sometimes we do end up perceiving it—but then its P3 wave is sharply delayed. This is the “refractory period” phenomenon that we met in Chapter 1: before a second target enters consciousness, it must wait until the conscious mind is done with the first one.

    TODO：选用更好的总结段落。

所以，保持 mindfulness 的有效方法，就是主动地、有意识地保持对觉知（conscious access）的把控和占用。如此一来，不可控且有蔽的想法（directed thoughts）便自然失去了立足之地。[^working-principle] 反之，如果不能保持对觉知的把控和占用，那么不可控的想法自然会趁虚而入，占领觉知。[^spontaneous-thoughts]

[^working-principle]: 《The Power of Mindfulness》（Nyanaponika Thera）：

    > The working principle here is the simple fact that two [directed] thoughts cannot coexist at the same time: if the clear light of mindfulness is present, there is no room for mental twilight. When sustained mindfulness has secured a firm foothold, it will be a matter of comparatively secondary importance how the mind will then deal with those rudimentary thoughts, moods and emotions. One may just dismiss them and replace them by purposeful thoughts; or one may allow and even compel them to complete what they have to say. In the latter case they will often reveal how poor and weak they actually are, and it will then not be difficult to dispose of them once they are forced into the open. This procedure of bare attention is very simple and effective; the difficulty is only the persistence in applying it.

[^spontaneous-thoughts]: 《Consciousness and the Brain》，第五章：

    > In fact, organized spontaneous activity is omnipresent in the nervous system. Anyone who has ever seen an EEG knows this: the two hemispheres constantly generate massive high-frequency electrical waves, whether the person is awake or asleep. This spontaneous excitation is so intense that it dominates the landscape of brain activity. By comparison, the activation evoked by an external stimulus is barely detectable, and much averaging is needed before it can be observed. Stimulus-evoked activity accounts for only a very small amount of the total energy consumed by the brain, probably less than 5 percent. The nervous system primarily acts as an autonomous device that generates its own thought patterns. Even in the dark, while we rest and “think of nothing,” our brain constantly produces complex and ceaselessly changing arrays of neuronal activity.
    >
    > Furthermore, this internal stream competes with the external world. During moments of high default-mode activity, the presentation of an unexpected stimulus such as a picture no longer evokes a large P3 brain wave, as it does in an attentive subject. Endogenous states of consciousness interfere with our ability to become aware of external events. Spontaneous brain activity invades the global workspace and, if absorbing, can block access to other stimuli for extended periods of time. We met a variant of this phenomenon in Chapter 1 under the name of “inattentional blindness.”

那么，如何主动地、有意识地保持对觉知（conscious access）的把控和占用呢？首先要有意识地察觉，清楚当下觉知在何处；然后有意识地引导觉知，使之保持在一件事物上。就像一束光，持续地照在一件事物上，使之保持可见的状态。可以通过简单地标记（mental noting）事物的状态，来帮助察觉和引导觉知。

以呼吸为例。在不费力就能察觉到呼吸的情况下，有意识地将觉知（conscious access）保持在呼吸上：在吸气的时候标记“吸气”，同时感知吸气的*整个*过程；在呼气的时候标记“呼气”，同时感知呼气的*整个*过程。对于动作、感受、想法等等，也是一样。

## 日常的 meditation

与其说是在日常生活中练习 meditation，毋宁说是将日常生活作为 meditation 的练习场所[^full-life-practice]。

[^full-life-practice]: 《The Heart of Buddhist Meditation》，Clear Comprehension 一节：

    > 1. If a particular, i.e. single, subject of meditation is practiced, one should try to blend it with the work or thought directly required by the day's occupations; or, expressed conversely, the work at hand should be given a place in the framework of the meditation, as an illustration of its subject.
    > 2. But if ones meditative practice is all-round Mindfulness, as advocated here, there will be no need ever to lay aside the subject of meditation which, in fact, will include everything. Step by step the Practice of Right Mindfulness should absorb all activities of body, speech and mind, so that ultimately the subject of meditation will never be abandoned. [……] The aim to be aspired to by the disciple of this method is that _life_ becomes one with the spiritual _practice_, and that the practice becomes full-blooded _life_.
    > Therefore the disciple of this method should always ask himself, in the words of Santideva: ‘How can the practice of Mindfulness be performed under these very circumstances?’

## FAQ

### 并不是所有的 directed thoughts 都是不可控的或有蔽的

A：目的是为了保持 mindfulness，使得我们能够充分地了解事物，让感知到的事物的特性变得清晰完整。参见 _动机_ 一节。

### 与日常所说的专注力有何区别

A：Meditation 看上去像是在训练专注力，但其实两者区别很大。对于我们日常所说的专注力，例如专注于读小说、看电影等等，当我们保持专注时，对注意力并未有觉察。这种情况下，我们容易成为注意力的仆从，陷入其中却不自知。与之相对地，meditation 所培养的专注力，是一种有意识的对注意力——觉知（conscious access）——保持察觉和引导的能力，此时，我们是注意力的监督者和引导者，将其引向对事物的敏锐洞察和深刻理解。

### 把觉知放到事物上时，仍有其它事物或念头进入到觉知中

A：要点不在把其它事物或念头排除在觉知（conscious access）之外，这似乎也是不可能的。而在于不使其“成长”，以至于主导觉知。
