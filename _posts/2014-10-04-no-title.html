<p>
Now I'm confused. What shall I do? What shall I need?
</p>
<p>
As what I concerned before (<a href="http://shuiruge.github.io/blogs/2014/07/26/By-the-Sea/">by the sea</a>), a proper idea CAN not come from nothing. It ONLY comes from chaotic, from depth, with clearness like stream.
</p>
<p>
There are, now, so many conceptions flashing in my mind, when I'm walking, reading, even sleeping. "Trans-planckian", "Casimir effect", "Bianchi I"&hellip;&hellip;So, what I shall do is concentrating on these conceptions, figuring out what they really are, in physics, clarifying the effects in cosmological inflation epoch. This is all what I shall do and will do.
</p>
<p>
All I need is patience; and trees never grow up with nothing.
