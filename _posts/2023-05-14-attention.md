## Human Brain is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Attention is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] By activating regulatory mediators, the neural circuits that are relevant to what is attended become sensitized and synchronized, and those that are ignored become habituated. [^modulating-mechanism]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the section "Attentional Control Networks" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_.

## Stable Attention Leads to Whole-Brain Synchronization

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable; it is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural circuits that are currently relevant become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized.

If, however, attention is stable, then the sensitization, the synchronization, and the habituation will become more and more salient. The brain comes to know what is important and what is not. The whole network are modulated to be synchronous.

It is because of this whole-brain synchronization that we feel inner peace.

## Monitoring Attention is the Only Ability Need for Stabilizing Attention

What happened when we try to stabilize our attention to some object? First, we have to know if our attention is still on that object. If not, then we let go the distraction and redirect attention back to that object. That is all. So, there are three abilities employed in this process: the ability of monitoring where the attention locates, of letting go the distraction, and of voluntarily redirecting the attention. But, not all these abilities are essential. In fact, if we can realize our attention is no longer on that object at the first place, no further distraction has occurred yet, then letting go the distraction and redirecting the attention would be quite natural. So, when the first ability is gained, the others are fulfilled on their own. The unique ability we need for stabilizing our attention is the ability of monitoring where the attention locates at every moment.

## Insight Meditation Trains the Ability of Monitoring Attention

Insight meditation is the practice that trains the mental ability of monitoring where the attention locates at every moment with little effort. As a result, we can be aware of any distraction immediately after its arising, so as to bring attention back to what was going to attend in the first place. In this way, attention can be voluntarily stabilized to any object. While redirecting attention from one object to another, as it always happens in daily activities, the stability will be sustained.

During insight meditation, practitioner should constantly check where the attention locates by making mental notes. For instance, when attending to a tactile sensation, make a mental note "touching", when attending to a sound, "hearing", and when thinking about the sound, "thinking". The practice starts from the most prominent objects, gradually extends to the subtle. Throughout the daily activities, endeavor should not be slackened, and every moment should be checked and noted. Just like we learned to ride bicycle. It took effort to keep balance at the beginning. But when practice matures, we can keep balance with little effort. The same goes for insight meditation. As the result of diligent practice, no matter what we are doing, the mind can vigilantly monitor where the attention locates at every moment with little effort. And subtle distraction comes to be apparent on its own.

## Practice should be Gradual and Methodical

In the beginning, practitioner cannot catch up the swift attention. It is frequently found that attention is already elsewhere when a mental note is made. This is like learning English. A beginner cannot gain any skill by directly listening BBC. Frustration also raises. One should start by listening low speed simple sentences. And gradually, BBC would become understandable. The same goes for insight meditation. A beginner should concentrate to the tactile sensation of breathing, in nasal cavity or on abdomen. With this, attention will be greatly restricted. Practitioner will find that following the attention is not so hard anymore. While concentrating to breath, mental noting should not slackened; it must be persisted without a break. When any bodily movement is inevitable, practitioner should move slowly, and attention should be concentrated on the part of body that is moving, so that mental notes can catch up. Even though concentrated, there is still possibility that multiple things are attended in a second. Before the practice matures, simply omitting the subtle or transient object would be greatly benefit.
