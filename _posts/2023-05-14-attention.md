## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Attention Is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] Paying attention with intent sensitizes the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is attend. And ignoring, namely noticing without reacting by physical or mental deed, habituates the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is ignored. Importantly, both sensitization and habituation are chemically mediated. [^modulating-mechanism] [^modulation-instance]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the section "Attentional Control Networks" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_.

  [^modulating-mechanism]: For the details of sensitization and habituation, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^modulation-instance]: For instance, one day a dog ran towards you, and then bit you. This event would trigger two neural pathways. Along direct pathway, the visual information of a dog processed in your visual circuit was delivered to your amygdala. Following the bite, intense pain generated on your skin was delivered, again, to your amygdala to trigger fear emotion. Within amygdala, the visual information and the fear emotion encountered, leading to an instantaneous formation of dog-fear classical conditioning. The next time when you see a dog runs towards you, this dog-fear conditioning will be triggered, so that you will feel intense fear again, even though it just wants to play with you. There is, however, an indirect pathway along which the visual and the following sensory information were first transmitted into the corresponding cortices, and then, after more complicated processing, from the cortices to amygdala, triggering fear emotion again. Attention influences the dog-fear conditioning along the indirect pathway. While in the next time a dog runs towards you to play with you (not to bite you), your mind may recall the previous scene, and may fall into a reverie, thinking about much worse scenes that have not happened yet. These thoughts, in which attention plays a central role, will intensify the fear emotion along the indirect pathway, thus sensitize and strengthen the dog-fear conditioning. Contrarily, by voluntarily directing your attention to, for example, simple awareness of the fear emotion, thoughts that would sensitize the conditioning will not raise, the dog-fear conditioning will naturally be habituated and weakened.

## Stable Attention Triggers Synaptic Plasticity

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable; it is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural circuits that are currently attended become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized. In this situation, the chemical mediators cannot accumulate in synapses.

If, however, attention can be brought back to what is going to attend in the first place whenever it is taken away, then the chemical mediators will accumulate enough to trigger synaptic plasticity, leading to anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] The sensitization and the habituation then become long-lasting. In this way, we can plant what we want to cultivate, such as loving-kindness, and uproot what we want to eliminate, such as disturbing thoughts.

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators that leads to sensitization are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within neurons. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to a long-term sensitization.

      TODO: explain for habituation.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

Once what disturbs the mind is uprooted, long-lasting peacefulness is left.

## Monitoring Attention Is the Only Ability Need for Stabilizing Attention

What happened when we try to stabilize our attention to some object? First, we have to know if our attention is still on the object. If not, then we let go the distraction and redirect attention back to the object with intent. That is all. So, there are three abilities employed in this process: the ability of monitoring where attention locates, of letting go the distraction, and of redirecting attention with intent. But, not all these abilities are essential. In fact, if we can realize our attention is no longer on that object at the first place, no further distraction has occurred yet, then letting go the distraction and redirecting attention with intent would be quite natural. So, when the first ability is gained, the others are fulfilled on their own. The unique ability we need for stabilizing our attention is the ability of monitoring where attention locates at every moment.

## Insight Meditation Trains the Ability of Monitoring Attention

Insight meditation is the practice that trains the mental ability of monitoring where attention locates at every moment with little effort. As a result, we can be aware of any distraction immediately after its arising, so as to bring attention back to what was going to attend in the first place. In this way, attention can be voluntarily stabilized to any object. While redirecting attention from one object to another, as it always happens in daily activities, the stability will be sustained.

During insight meditation, practitioner should constantly check where attention locates by making mental notes. For instance, when attending to a tactile sensation, make a mental note "touching", when attending to a sound, "hearing", and when thinking about the sound, "thinking". The practice starts from the most prominent objects, gradually extends to the subtle. Throughout the daily activities, endeavor should not be slackened, and every moment should be checked and noted. Just like we learned to ride bicycle. It took effort to keep balance at the beginning. But when practice matures, we can keep balance with little effort. The same goes for insight meditation. As the result of diligent practice, no matter what we are doing, the mind can vigilantly monitor where attention locates at every moment with little effort. And subtle distraction comes to be apparent on its own.

## Practice Should Be Gradual and Methodical

In the beginning, practitioner cannot catch up the swift attention. It is frequently found that attention is already elsewhere when a mental note is made. This is like learning English. A beginner cannot gain any skill by directly listening BBC. Frustration also raises. One should start by listening low speed simple sentences. And gradually, BBC would become understandable. The same goes for insight meditation. A beginner should concentrate to the tactile sensation of breathing, in nasal cavity or on abdomen. With this, attention will be greatly restricted. Practitioner will find that following attention is not so hard anymore. While concentrating to breath, mental noting should not slackened; it must be persisted without a break. When any bodily movement is inevitable, practitioner should move slowly, and attention should be concentrated on the part of body that is moving, so that mental notes can catch up. Even though concentrated, there is still possibility that multiple things are attended in a second. Before the practice matures, simply omitting the subtle or transient object would be greatly benefit.
