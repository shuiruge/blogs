## Human Brain Is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. To lift your hand, for instance, a neural pathway through multiple motor and sensory circuits is activated, which results in a steady hand lifting. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Attention Is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] Paying attention with intent sensitizes the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is attend. And ignoring, namely noticing without reacting by physical or mental deed, habituates the synapses along the neural pathways that are relevant to what is ignored. Importantly, both sensitization and habituation are chemically mediated. [^sensitization-and-habituation]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the section "Attentional Control Networks" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_.

  [^sensitization-and-habituation]: The word "sensitize" brings to mind that paying attention to a part of your body will enhance the feeling there, or that hearing becomes more sensitive when you are cued to pay attention to a certain type of voice. Contrarily, the word "habituate" reminds of the situation when you get used to the terrible smell of toilet, or to the background noise you do not care about.

    For the details of sensitization and habituation, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

## Stable Attention Triggers Synaptic Plasticity

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable; it is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural circuits that are currently attended become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized. In this situation, the chemical mediators cannot accumulate in synapses.

If, however, attention can be brought back to what is going to attend in the first place whenever it is taken away, then the chemical mediators will accumulate enough to trigger synaptic plasticity, leading to anatomical changes in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity] The sensitization and the habituation then become long-lasting. In this way, we can plant what we want to cultivate, such as loving-kindness, and uproot what we want to eliminate, such as disturbing thoughts [^disturbing-thoughts].

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical mediators that leads to sensitization are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within neurons. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the mediators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to a long-term sensitization.

      TODO: explain for habituation.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^disturbing-thoughts]: Once what disturbs the mind is uprooted, long-lasting peacefulness is left.

## Monitoring the Mind Is the Only Ability Need for Stabilizing Attention

What happened when we try to stabilize our attention to some object? First, we have to know if our mind is still focused and on the object. If not, then let go the distraction if there is any, and focus on the object with intent again. That is all. So, there are three abilities employed in this process: the ability of monitoring the mind [^mind], of letting go the distraction, and of focus with intent. But, not all these abilities are essential. In fact, if we can realize our mind is no longer focused or no longer on that object at the first place, no further distraction has occurred yet, then letting go the distraction and focus with intent would be quite natural. So, when the first ability is gained, the others are fulfilled on their own. The unique ability we need for stabilizing our attention is the ability of monitoring our mind at every moment.

  [^mind]: In other words, consciousness.

It is helpful to think of the mind as a "room of awareness", an imagined room filled with objects of different sizes. Objects are those appearing in the mind. And the size of an object is irrelevant to the actual size of the object, but simply indicating how much attention is focused on it, since the larger the size of an object in the room of awareness, the more space of the mind is occupied by it. Monitoring the mind is like checking the room.

## Insight Meditation Trains the Ability of Monitoring the Mind

Insight meditation is the practice that trains the mental ability of monitoring the mind at every moment with little effort. Practitioner of insight meditation should constantly check his mind with unremitting endeavor during the period of his practice. Just like we learned to ride bicycle. It took effort to keep balance at the beginning. But when practice matures, we can keep balance with little effort. The same goes for insight meditation. As the result of diligent practice, no matter what we are doing, the mind can vigilantly monitor itself at every moment with little effort.

## Practice Should Be Gradual and Methodical

In the beginning, practitioner cannot catch up the swift mind, since in daily life the mind jumps back and forth between so many things. It is like learning language. A beginner cannot gain any skill by joining a native party directly. Frustration also raises. One should start by listening low speed simple sentences. And gradually, talking with a native speaker would become natural. The same goes for insight meditation. Just before a session of practice, a beginner should first restrict his mind by concentrating on the tactile sensation of breathing, in nasal cavity or on abdomen, so that the attractive things from the inner and outer worlds may lose their momentum. And gradually, practicing in daily life would become natural.
