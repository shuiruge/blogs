## Human Brain is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_, by E. Kandel, et al., the 6th edition.

## Attention is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] By activating regulatory mediators, the neural circuits that are relevant to what is attended become sensitized and synchronized, and those that are ignored become habituated. [^modulating-mechanism]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the section "Attentional Control Networks" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_ by M. Gazzaniga, et al., the 5th edition.

## Concentration Leads to Whole-Brain Synchronization

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable. It is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, gross or subtle, so that neural circuits that are currently relevant become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized.

If, however, attention is stabilized, then the sensitization, the synchronization, and the habituation become more and more salient. The brain comes to know what is important and what is not. The whole network are modulated to be synchronous.

It is because of this whole-brain synchronization that we feel inner peace.

## Insight Meditation Builds up Concentration

Insight meditation is the practice that trains the mental ability of monitoring where the attention locates at every moment with little effort. As a result, we can be aware of any distraction immediately after its arising, so as to bring attention back to what was going to attend in the first place. In this way, attention can be voluntarily stabilized to any object. While redirecting attention to another object, as it always happens in daily activities, the stability will be sustained.

During insight meditation, practitioner should constantly check where the attention locates by making mental notes. For instance, when attending to a tactile sensation, make a mental note "touching", when attending to a sound, "hearing", and when thinking about the sound, "thinking". The practice starts from the most prominent objects, gradually extends to the subtle. Throughout the daily activities, endeavor should not be slackened, and every moment should be checked and noted. Just like we learned to ride bicycle. It took effort to keep balance at the beginning. But with repeated practice, we can keep balance with little effort. The same goes for insight meditation. As the result of diligent practice, no matter what we are doing, the mind can vigilantly monitor where the attention locates at every moment with little effort. And subtle distraction comes to be apparent on its own.
