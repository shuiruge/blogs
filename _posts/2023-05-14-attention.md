title: Attention, Synchronization, and Meditation

## Human Brain is a Modularized Network

Human brain consists of many individual neural circuits, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Neural circuits are then connected as a network. In this way, different neural circuits cooperate with each other to mediate complex behaviors such as bodily movements and thinking. [^modularized-network]

  [^modularized-network]: See the chapter "The Brain and Behavior" of _Principles of Neural Science_, by E. Kandel, et al., the 6th edition.

## Attention is a Modulating Mechanism

Attention modulates the behavior of the network. [^attention-types] By activating regulatory mediators, the neural circuits that are relevant to what is attended become sensitized and synchronized, and those that are ignored become habituated. [^modulating-mechanism]

  [^attention-types]: In fact, there are two kinds of attention, mediated by different neural mechanisms. Voluntary attention is top-down, modulating the neural circuits. Conversely, reflexive attention is bottom-up, aroused by the strong stimuli from the inner and outer worlds. But in this note, discussions are restricted to voluntary attention. See the chapter "Attention" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_ by M. Gazzaniga, et al., the 5th edition.

## Concentration Leads to Whole-Brain Synchronization

Many stimuli from the inner and outer worlds are competing for your attention. Generally, attention is unstable. It is constantly being taken away by different stimuli, so that neural circuits that are currently relevant become ignored in the next moment, and that are temporally habituated soon become sensitized.

If, however, attention is stabilized, then the sensitization, the synchronization, and the habituation become more and more salient. The brain comes to know what is important and what is not. The whole network are modulated to be synchronous.

It is because of this whole-brain synchronization that we feel inner peace.

## Meditation Builds up Concentration

Meditation is the practice that trains the mind to be vigilant to potential distractions that may take attention away. As a result, we can bring attention back to what was going to attend from any distraction immediately after its arising. In this way, attention can be voluntarily stabilized to any object. While voluntarily redirecting attention to another object, as it always happens in daily activities, the stability will be sustained.

In meditation, we direct our attention to an object that is currently perceived as prominent and persistent if there is any, otherwise to the bodily sensation of breathing, which is always there. If you find your attention has been distracted, then gently bring it back. Throughout the daily activities, practice should not be slackened.
