title: A Poem about Peacefulness
---

As plastic as a wooden board,  
mind is craved by the departed.  
Dormant imprints in subconscious.  
Woken up by similar situations.  

A mind without focus is thus driven to  
to do what have been done in the past.  
Whenever the switch is turned on,  
the lamp becomes bright.  

Focusing on single object,  
mind forbids the others.  
Imprint keeps dormant,  
but not disappears.  

Focusing on each moment,  
mind is busy with perceiving.  
No mind for anything else.  
Nor for an imprint to arise.  
Similar situation turns to loosen  
the imprint that would be woken.  

No disturbance from subconscious.  
The mind goes back to peace.  
Like the surface of a lake.  
The wind has gone, stillness is left.
