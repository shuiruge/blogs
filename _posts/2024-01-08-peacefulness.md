title: Way to Peacefulness
---

Conflict arises when things happen so and we expect something else. So, for dissolving conflicts, we have to accept all that is happening without expecting anything else; and if we do expect, just accept the expectation, which is a thought, another thing that is happening. In this way, conflicts dissolve and peacefulness, as the opposite, naturally arises.

So, the problem of conflicts is the reaction to things. We have to be aware of the reaction to anything when it happens.

Based on a [previous note](2024-01-04-synaptic-plasticity.md), to obtain the mental ability of persistent bare observation of mind, we have to sustain an anticipation where the stimulus is the thing that is perceived and the behavior is being aware of the raction to it.
