title: A Poem about Anticipation, Synaptic Plasticity, and Introspection
---

## The Poem

Neurons are united as circuit,  
together to mediate a function.  
Then circuit by circuit,  
connected by synapses,  
pathway chains them as beads. [^neural-circuit]  

Anticipation is an intention:  
when stimuli of a kind is received,  
a specific behavior is followed. [^anticipation]  
Stimulating a circuit might activate  
many pathways that succeeds.  
As many paths you can choose  
at any corner in a city.  
But anticipation ensures  
only one pathway is to be activated,  
that from the stimuli to the behavior. [^modulation]  
Its synapses have to be facilitated,  
as the roads are broadened,  
so the pathway can beat the others,  
whenever the stimuli is received.  
Facilitation by chemical modulators.  
They are produced in the synapses,  
at each moment it is anticipated.  
Persist for a while, soon metabolized. [^chemical-modulators]  

When continually anticipate  
an anticipation without a break,  
produced more than metabolized,  
the chemical modulators accumulate.  
Concentrations rush high and  
plasticity is triggered.  
In a short period it forms  
long-lasting change in the synapses. [^synaptic-plasticity]  
By simply sustaining it,  
anticipation becomes a reality.  
As reality is so plastic.  

But mind desires to wander around.  
It must be carefully watched,  
for an anticipation can be sustained.  
An introspection that is persistent.  
For plasticity it is important. [^breath-example]

  [^anticipation]: Throughout this note, we use the word "anticipation" in this narrow sense. For example, we can anticipate feeling more and more relaxed as the clock ticks, where the stimuli come from the clock ticks and the behavior is active relaxation. When practicing guitar, the stimuli come from playing a chord and the behavior is playing the successive one. Notice that anticipation is independent of the appearance of the stimuli; it is an intention, a mental activity.

  [^modulation]: As an example, when we are cued to detect red objects, the neural pathway that responsible for detecting red color is facilitated, so that whenever we see an object, this neural pathway has much higher probability of being activated, so that we can detect red object correctly but missing the objects with other colors. The famous "invisible gorilla" experiment made by Daniel Simons is another example.

  [^chemical-modulators]: There are two kinds of receptors on the membranes of synapses. One is ionotropic receptor, which _mediates_ the propagation of electrical signals. The other is metabotropic receptor, which _modulates_ the propagation by modifying the strength of synapses. When specific molecules bind to a metabotropic receptor,  it changes its shape and reveals some sites. These sites will activate specific enzymes, the chemical modulators, which then diffuse in the synapse to catalyze a series of chemical reactions that facilitate or inhibit the release or the reception of neurotransmitters. An activated metabotropic receptor is like a started coffee machine, and inactive enzymes are exhausted workers. They drift to the coffee machine, drink espresso, and become energetic and capable of work. They will keep energetic for a while, from hundreds of milliseconds to minutes, then becomes exhausted again. Any time when a metabotropic receptor is activated, some amount of the active enzymes is produced in the synapse.

    For the types of receptor, see chapter 11 of _Principles of Neural Science_. And for the details of metabotropic receptors, see chapter 14 of the same book.

  [^synaptic-plasticity]: The chemical modulators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway are the second messengers, such as protein kinase A, which will accumulate within the synapses. If the period of accumulation becomes sufficient, then there would be possible that the modulators move into nucleus, triggering the expression of DNA that produces the proteins for building synapses. This leads to an anatomical change in the synapses.

      It should be noted that not all classes of neuron are equally modifiable. For instance, the neurons for primary physiological functions should not be plastic.

      For details, see chapter 53 of _Principles of Neural Science_.

  [^breath-example]: Here is an example illustrating what happens when we try to sustained the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath. The stimuli come from air striking the nasal cavity and the behavior is sensing the nasal sensation. Usually, we do not feel the nasal sensation when air strikes the nasal cavity. But when we anticipate like "sense the nasal sensation when in/out-breathe" at each inspiration and expiration, it is felt immediately that the nasal sensation caused by breathing stands out from the blurry background of mind. This is because the synapses along the neural pathway from the stimuli of air striking to the behavior of sensing the nasal sensation are facilitated, so it is ensured that, when air strikes the nasal cavity, it is this neural pathway, rather than any other that succeeds to the stimuli of air striking, that is activated. Even though subtle, it has indicated that the neural pathway from the stimuli to the behavior does exist and be modulable. This modulation is mediated by the chemical modulators in the synapses along the modulated neural pathway. With sustained effort of anticipating, the feeling comes to be coarser and coarser, and increasingly consistent. Details reveal themselves. You can distinctly feel the nasal sensation all along the breath, from the beginning of inspiration to the end of expiration. This is the effect of accumulation of the chemical modulators. But, it will not last long. The mind is constantly searching for something attractive, something new. When the mind slips away, if it is detected in time, we bring the mind back to the anticipation again. Then, nothing is really interrupted and the accumulation goes on. Otherwise, the mind goes astray and soon the chemical modulators lose their concentrations. When the anticipation can be sustained, nothing stops the chemical modulators accumulating. Synaptic plasticity is then triggered in an extreme way. It is like forming highly emotional memory: long-lasting changes are made in a period that is short.

    The process illustrated here holds not for the anticipation of sensing the nasal sensation that follows each breath alone, but for any anticipation to which a modulable neural pathway corresponds, since the principle behind is the same.
