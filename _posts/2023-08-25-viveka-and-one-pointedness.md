title: Viveka and One-Pointedness

## Viveka

Viveka is the insight knowledge of discriminating moments. Yogis and buddhists found that consciousness is not a continuum, but constitutes a series of indivisible temporal units, called moments. [^moments] It is like a movie made up of a series of frames. These moments are transient, leaving to us the illusion that consciousness is continuous. He who gains viveka has the ability of discriminating these moments, realizing that a moment and the following are distinct, and that only after the falling of the preceding will a moment arise.

[^moments]: For details, see chapter 4 of _A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma_, and the sections from 3.51 to 3.53 in _The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_.

## One-Pointedness

One-pointedness is the state of attention that is stabilized to a single object. As discussed in a [previous note](2023-05-20-meditation.md), the key to one-pointedness is the ability of monitoring the mind.

He who gains viveka gains the highest ability of monitoring the mind [^mind]. For him, the mind comes to be a series of moments in which every moment is realized, so that nothing can escape from his sight.

  [^mind]: Recall that we use mind as an equivalent of consciousness.

So, he who gains viveka gains the most perfect one-pointedness.
