title: Viveka and One-Pointedness
---

## Viveka

Viveka is the insight knowledge of discriminating moments. Yogis and buddhists found that consciousness is not continuous, but constitutes a sequence of indivisible temporal units, called moments. These moments are transient, so that we have the illusion that consciousness is continuous, as is the case with film. But, he who gains viveka has the ability of discriminating these moments, realizing that a moment and the one that follows are distinct. He will view the world that is perceived by his consciousness as a sequence of events, moment by moment.

## One-Pointedness

One-pointedness is the state of attention that is stabilized to a single object. As discussed in the [previous note](./2023-05-20-meditation.md), the key to one-pointedness is the ability of monitoring the mind.

He who gains viveka gains the highest ability of monitoring the mind [^mind]. For him, the mind comes to be a sequence of moments in which every moment is realized, so that nothing can escape from his sight.

  [^mind]: Recall that we use mind as an equivalent of consciousness.

So, he who gains viveka gains the most perfect one-pointedness.
