title: Human Brain, Habitual Response, and Meditative Practice

## Human Brain

1. The unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. Consciousness connects the modules together via long distance neuronal connections across the brain. Modules communicates with each other either by local neuron circuits or by consciousness.
    1. In neuroscience, _modules_ are specialized neural circuits that process only specific types of inputs. And in cognitive psychology, modules are characterized by their information encapsulation, domain specificity, and automatic processing.
    1. For experimental details, see the third section of _Towards a cognitive neuroscience of consciousness_ by S. Dehaene and L. Naccache (2001).

1. By local neuron circuits, information is shared between the assembly of several locally connected modules. A _super-module_ is such an assembly which, like other modules, runs concurrently and unconsciously.

1. By consciousness, information is shared to more modules that are connected to consciousness, and more modules are to participate in processing the shared information. The stronger the connection between the module and consciousness, the more probable it is to participate.
    1. The Bottom-up stimuli from a module first reverberate in local circuits. Now, if the top-down attention is drawn to the stimuli, then it reverberates along the bidirectional neuronal connections between the module and consciousness. This long distance reverberation will greatly amplify the stimuli, making it suddenly rush out of the local region of consciousness, into a much wider area that consciousness connects, leading to a cross brain reverberation. More modules are, then, commandeered to process the shared information.
        1. For instance, when we are visually conscious of something, we think about it. While thinking, the lingual and auditory modules are commandeered for self-talk; the visual module is commandeered for imagining; and the module of working memory is commandeered for recording the recent events.
        1. For details, see the Figure 1 of _Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy_ by S. Dehaene, J. Changeux, L. Naccache, J. Sackur, and C. Sergent (2006).
    1. Contribution from the top-down stimuli to a unconscious module is weighted by the strength of the connection between the module and consciousness. So, if the connection is weak, the top-down stimuli will be overwhelmed by the stimuli within the module or a super-module in which the module sits. The module will, then, not process the shared information.
        1. This does not mean that information of the module weakly connected to consciousness will never come into consciousness. There are two factors that contribute to the information propagation: the strength of stimuli and the strength of connection. So, when attention is drawn onto the module, top-down stimuli towards the module is greatly amplified, so that the module is triggered even though the connection to consciousness is weak.

1. Attention is essential for information sharing via consciousness.
    1. For instance, when you are talking while walking, attention is focused on what you are saying. Then, you cannot notice the constantly changing posture of your body, since attention is unique but it is not there.
    1. To be conscious, it's essential that bottom-up stimulus from a module has sufficient duration and strength, and that top-down attention is directed to that which the module relates to.

## Habitual Response

1. If a series of modules has been triggered in due order for many times, then connections between these modules are strengthened, so that a new super-module is created. Within a super-module, once the first module is triggered, the following modules are triggered in due order, just like dominoes.
    1. Neurons that fire together wire together.

1. _Habitual response_ is the behavioral manifestation of super-module. It goes unconsciously, no need of attention.
    1. For instance, talking with others while driving along a familiar road. Driving now is unconscious. And the mind is attending to elsewhere.
    1. But we can be conscious of them once they have happened. For instance, the intention to speak and the initial moment of speaking go unconsciously. We are soon aware of them because of the feedback stimuli from auditory module. The same applies to the next moment of speaking, and the next, and the next.
    1. In Buddhisms, habitual response is called _kamma_ in Pali, or _karma_ in Sanskrit.

1. The years have imprints on us: lots of habitual responses have been created because of what has past. We feel unpeaceful because of these habitual responses, which drive us chasing what we like and rejecting what we dislike.

## Meditative Practice

1. _Meditative practice_ is the methodical practice that intentionally brings what is unconscious to consciousness, aiming to strengthen the connections between unconscious modules and consciousness.

1. Practitioner practices noticing all what is being perceived in our body and mind at every moment. Practice that strengthens the attention to be stable and steerable is also essential.
    1. Attention is the tool for meditative practice. And it is very essential to make it sharp.
    1. For detailed instructions, see the book _Practical Insight Meditation_ written by Mahasi Sayadaw, translated by U Pe Thin and Myanaung U Tin.

1. With repeated practice, the connections between unconscious modules and consciousness become stronger and stronger, and more and more modules are to participate in processing the information whenever it is shared through consciousness. The brain is united.
    1. Again, neurons that fire together wire together.

1. Naturally, the circuits of super-modules will be interrupted and finally fade away, and no stable super-module will be formed again. The brain is purified.
    1. Since now modules are united to process the shared information, the old circuit is interrupted. This interruption, then, loosens up the connections in the super-module, until fading away.
    1. As a whole brain process, no stable local circuit has opportunity to form.
    1. This is what it means in Buddhisms that an Arhat gets rid of his karma, and no new karma will be created.
