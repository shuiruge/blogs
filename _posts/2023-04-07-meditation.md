title: Human Brain, Habitual Response, and Meditative Practice

## Human Brain

- The unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds.
    - In neuroscience, _modules_ are specialized neural circuits that process only specific types of inputs.
    - In cognitive psychology, modules are characterized by their information encapsulation, domain specificity, and automatic processing.

- Consciousness connects the modules together via long distance neuronal connections across the brain.

- Modules communicates with each other either by local neuron circuits or by consciousness.

- By local neuron circuits, information is shared between the assembly of several locally connected modules.

- A _super-module_ is such an assembly which, like other modules, runs concurrently and unconsciously.

- By consciousness, information is shared to all modules that are connected to consciousness, and all of them are to participate in the processing of the shared information.
    - The Bottom-up stimuli from a module first reverberate in local circuits. Now, if the top-down attention is drawn to the stimuli, then it reverberates along the bidirectional neuronal connections between the module and consciousness. This long distance reverberation will greatly amplify the stimuli, making it suddenly rush out of the local region of consciousness, into the whole space that consciousness connects, leading to a whole brain reverberation. Other preconscious modules are, then, commandeered to process the shared information.
        - For instance, when we are visually conscious of something, we think about it. While thinking, the lingual and auditory modules are commandeered for self-talk; the visual module is commandeered for imagining; and the module of working memory is commandeered for recording the recent events.
    - For more about the conscious process, see the paper _Towards a Cognitive Neuroscience of Consciousness_, by S. Dehaene and L. Naccache, 2001.

- So, modules are unified together via consciousness, forming a whole brain information processing.

- Attention is essential for information sharing via consciousness.
    - For instance, when you are talking while walking, attention is focused on what you are saying. Then, you cannot notice the constantly changing posture of your body, since attention is unique but it is not there.
    - To be conscious, it's essential that bottom-up stimulus from a module has sufficient duration and strength, and that top-down attention is directed to that which the module relates to.

## Habitual Response

- If a series of modules has been triggered in due order for many times, then connections between these modules are strengthened, so that a new super-module is created.
    - Neurons that fire together wire together.

- Within a super-module, once the first module is triggered, the following modules are triggered in due order, just like dominoes.

- _Habitual response_ is the behavioral manifestation of super-module.
    - In Buddhisms, habitual response is called _kamma_ in Pali, or _karma_ in Sanskrit.

- Habitual response processes unconsciously, without paying attention.
    - For instance, talking with others while driving along a familiar road. Driving now is unconscious. And the mind is attending to elsewhere.
    - But we can be conscious of them once they have happened. For instance, the intention to speak and the initial moment of speaking go unconsciously. We are soon aware of them because of the feedback stimuli from auditory module. The same applies to the next moment of speaking, and the next, and the next.

- The years have imprints on us: lots of habitual responses have been created because of what has past.

- We feel unpeaceful because of these habitual responses, which drive us chasing what we like and rejecting what we dislike.

## Meditative Practice

- _Meditative practice_ is the methodical practice that intentionally brings what is unconscious to consciousness, aiming to strengthen the long distance connections between unconscious modules and consciousness.

- Practitioner practices noticing all what is being perceived in our body and mind at every moment. Practice that strengthens the attention to be stable and steerable is also essential.
    - Attention is the tool for meditative practice. And it is very essential to make it sharp.
    - For detailed instructions, see the book _Practical Insight Meditation_ written by Mahasi Sayadaw, translated by U Pe Thin and Myanaung U Tin.

- With repeated practice, the long distance connections between unconscious modules and consciousness become sufficiently strong, so that the unconscious processes will come into consciousness in their own.
    - Neurons that fire together wire together.
    - For instance, at first, we will not notice the intentions every time we start to move, start to talk, and start to think, since they raise unconsciously. With repeated practice, however, the notice of such intentions becomes more and more natural and automatic. This indicates that the connections between modules of intentions and consciousness have been quite strong, and stimuli on either side will trigger those on the other.

- Then, information is shared and every module joins in. The brain is united.

- Naturally, the circuits of super-modules will be interrupted and finally fade away, and no stable super-module will be formed again. The brain is purified.
    - This is what it means in Buddhisms that an Arhat gets rid of his karma, and no new karma will be created.
    - Since new modules join in the process, the old circuit is interrupted. This interruption, then, loosens up the connections in the super-module, until fading away.
    - As a whole brain process, no stable local circuit has opportunity to form.
