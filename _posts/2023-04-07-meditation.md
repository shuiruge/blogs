## Human Brain

The unconscious consists of many individual modules, concurrently processing information that come from the inner and outer worlds. [^module] Consciousness connects the modules together via long distance neuronal connections across the brain. Modules communicates with each other either by local neuron circuits or by consciousness. [^consciousness-materials]

[^module]: In neuroscience, _modules_ [^conventions] are specialized neural circuits that process only specific types of inputs. And in cognitive psychology, modules are characterized by their information encapsulation, domain specificity, and automatic processing.

[^conventions]: Italics is employed for either books and articles, or defining proper nouns.

[^consciousness-materials]: For experimental details, see the third section of _Towards a cognitive neuroscience of consciousness_ by S. Dehaene and L. Naccache (2001).

By local neuron circuits, information is shared between the assembly of several locally connected modules. A _super-module_ is such an assembly which, like other modules, runs concurrently and unconsciously.

By consciousness, [^essential-conditions] information is shared to more modules that are connected to consciousness, and more modules are to participate in processing the shared information. [^conscious-process] The stronger the connection between the module and consciousness, the more probable it is to participate. [^connection-strength]

[^essential-conditions]: To be conscious, it's essential that bottom-up stimulus from a module has sufficient duration and strength, and that top-down attention is directed to that which the module relates to. [^attention-examples]

[^attention-examples]: For instance, when you are talking while walking, attention is focused on what you are saying. Then, you cannot notice the constantly changing posture of your body, since attention is not there.

[^conscious-process]: The Bottom-up stimuli from a module first reverberate in local circuits. Now, if the top-down attention is drawn to the stimuli, then it reverberates along the bidirectional neuronal connections between the module and consciousness. This long distance reverberation will greatly amplify the stimuli, making it suddenly rush out of the local region of consciousness, into a much wider area that consciousness connects, leading to a cross brain reverberation. More modules are, then, commandeered to process the shared information. [^commandeer-examples] [^conscious-process-materials]

[^commandeer-examples]: For instance, when we are visually conscious of something, we think about it. While thinking, the lingual and auditory modules are commandeered for self-talk; the visual module is commandeered for imagining; and the module of working memory is commandeered for recording the recent events.

[^conscious-process-materials]: For details, see the Figure 1 of _Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy_ by S. Dehaene, J. Changeux, L. Naccache, J. Sackur, and C. Sergent (2006).

[^connection-strength]: Contribution from the top-down stimuli to a unconscious module is weighted by the strength of the connection between the module and consciousness. So, if the connection is weak, the top-down stimuli will be overwhelmed by the stimuli within the module or a super-module in which the module sits. The module will, then, not process the shared information. [^two-factors]

[^two-factors]: This does not mean that information of the module weakly connected to consciousness will never come into consciousness. There are two factors that contribute to the information propagation: the strength of stimuli and the strength of connection. So, when attention is drawn onto the module, top-down stimuli towards the module is greatly amplified, so that the module is triggered even though the connection to consciousness is weak.

Attention is an "amplifier" which amplifies the stimuli to which it attends. [^amplifier-examples]

[^amplifier-examples]: Indeed, when we intentionally attends to the subtle sensations on feet, the sensations become conspicuous immediately.

## Habitual Response

If a series of modules has been triggered in due order for many times, then connections between these modules are strengthened [^Hebbian-rule], so that a new super-module is created. Within a super-module, once the first module is triggered, the following modules are triggered in due order, just like dominoes.

[^Hebbian-rule]: Neurons that fire together wire together. [^Hebbian-rule-materials]

[^Hebbian-rule-materials]: Reference to the section "Cellular Basis of Learning and Memory" of _Cognitive Neuroscience_ by M. Gazzaniga, R. Ivry, and G. Mangun, the fifth edition.

_Habitual response_ is the behavioral manifestation of super-module. It goes unconsciously, no need of attention. [^habitual-response-examples] [^conscious-habitual-response] [^kamma]

[^habitual-response-examples]: For instance, talking with others while driving along a familiar road. Driving now is unconscious. And the mind is attending to elsewhere.

[^conscious-habitual-response]: But we can be conscious of habitual responses once they have happened. For instance, the intention to speak and the initial moment of speaking go unconsciously. We are soon aware of them because of the feedback stimuli from auditory module. The same applies to the next moment of speaking, and the next, and the next.

[^kamma]: In Buddhisms, habitual response is called _kamma_ in Pali, or _karma_ in Sanskrit.

The years have imprints on us: lots of habitual responses have been created because of what has past. We feel unpeaceful because of these habitual responses, which drive us chasing what we like and rejecting what we dislike.

## Meditative Practice

_Meditative practice_ is the methodical practice that intentionally draw attention to what is unconscious or subtle to make it conspicuous in consciousness, [^mixed-process] aiming to strengthen the connections between unconscious modules and consciousness. [^bidirectional-effect]

[^mixed-process]: Many unconscious processes are actually more or less mixed with consciousness. Some parts of such process are completely unconscious, some parts are clearly conscious, and some parts in consciousness are very subtle. Meditative practice also, for the same purpose, intentionally draws attention to the subtle parts of the process, so as to make it conspicuous.

[^bidirectional-effect]: The effect of strengthening the connections is bidirectional. Because of the reverberation between unconscious module and consciousness, both top-down and bottom-up stimuli are amplified by it.

Practitioner practices noticing all what is being perceived in our body and mind at every moment. Practice that strengthens the attention to be stable and steerable is also essential. [^tool] [^attention-for-meditation] [^meditation-materials]

[^tool]: Attention is the primary tool for meditative practice. It is very essential to make it sharp.

[^attention-for-meditation]: Attention shall be stable so that the subtle can be amplified to be conspicuous, and be steerable so as to be aware where it is attended and direct to wherever we want. [^momentary-concentration]

[^momentary-concentration]: This kind of attention is called _momentary concentration_ by Mahasi Sayadaw in his book _Manual of Insight_.

[^meditation-materials]: For detailed instructions, see the section “The Basic Practice” of _Manual of Insight_ by Mahasi Sayadaw. [^two-practices]

[^two-practices]: Two kinds of practices are involved in the instructions: the primary practice with selected objects mainly aims to reinforce the attention; and the general practice aims to amplify the subtle aspects of the body-mind process using the reinforced attention.

With repeated practice, the connections between unconscious modules and consciousness become stronger and stronger, [^Hebbian-rule-again] and more and more modules are to participate in processing the information whenever it is shared through consciousness. [^meditation-effect] The brain is united. [^united-brain-materials]

[^Hebbian-rule-again]: Again, neurons that fire together wire together.

[^meditation-effect]: During practice, we find that it is more and more frequent to notice the subtle aspects of things, as if they are revealing themselves in front of us. These are the bottom-up echoes from the modules triggered by the top-down stimuli from consciousness.

[^united-brain-materials]: Experimental evidence can be found in the article _A case study of a meditation-induced altered state: increased overall gamma synchronization_ by A. Berkovich-Ohana (2015).

Naturally, the circuits of super-modules will be interrupted and finally fade away, [^interrupt-super-modules] and no stable super-module will be formed again. [^no-formation] The brain is purified. [^Arhat]

[^interrupt-super-modules]: Since now modules are united to process the shared information, the old circuit is interrupted. This interruption, then, loosens up the connections in the super-module, until fading away.

[^no-formation]: As a whole brain process, no stable local circuit has opportunity to form.

[^Arhat]: This is what it means in Buddhisms that an Arhat gets rid of his karma, and no new karma will be created.
