    <h1 translation="念住内观">Satipatthana Vipassana</h1>

    <p>On coming across the Teaching of the Buddha, it is most important for everyone to cultivate the virtues of moral conduct <i>(sila),</i> concentration <i>(samadhi),</i> and wisdom <i>(pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a).</i> One should undoubtedly possess these three virtues.</p>

    <p>For laypeople the minimal measure of moral conduct is the observance of the Five Precepts. For bhikkhus it is the observance of the Patimokkha, the code of monastic discipline. Anyone who is well-disciplined in moral conduct will be reborn in a happy realm of existence as a human being or a <i>deva</i> (god).</p>

    <p>However, this ordinary form of mundane morality <i>(lokiya-sila)</i> will not be a safeguard against relapse into the lower states of miserable existence, such as hell, the animal realm, or the realm of petas (ghosts). It is therefore desirable to cultivate the higher form of supramundane morality <i>(lokuttara-sila).</i> When one has fully acquired the virtue of this morality, one will be secure from relapse into the lower states and will always lead a happy life by being reborn as a human being or a deva. Everyone should therefore make it his duty to work for supramundane morality.</p>

    <p>There is every hope of success for anyone who strives sincerely and in real earnestness. It would indeed be a pity if anyone were to fail to take advantage of this fine opportunity of being endowed with higher qualities, for such a person will undoubtedly be a victim sooner or later of his own bad karma, which will pull him down to the lower states of miserable existence in hell, the animal realm, or the sphere of petas, where the span of life lasts for many hundreds, thousands or millions of years. It is therefore emphasized here that coming across the Teaching of the Buddha is the unique opportunity to work for path morality <i>(magga-sila)</i> and fruition morality <i>(phala-sila).</i></p>

    <p>It is not, however, advisable to work for moral conduct alone. It is also necessary to practice <i>samadhi</i> or concentration. Samadhi is the fixed or tranquil state of mind. The ordinary or undisciplined mind is in the habit of wandering to other places. It cannot be kept under control, but follows any idea, thought or imagination, etc. In order to prevent this wandering, the mind should be made to attend repeatedly to a selected object of concentration. On gaining practice, the mind gradually abandons its distractions and remains fixed on the object to which it is directed. This is samadhi.</p>

    <p>There are two kinds of concentration: mundane concentration <i>(lokiya-samadhi)</i> and supramundane concentration <i>(lokuttara-samadhi).</i> Of these two, the former consists in the mundane absorptions, such as the four <i>rupa-jhanas</i> &mdash; the absorptions pertaining to the world of form &mdash; and the four <i>arupa-jhanas</i> &mdash; the absorptions pertaining to the formless world. These can be attained by the practice of tranquillity meditation <i>(samatha-bhavana)</i> with such methods as mindfulness of breathing, loving-kindness <i>(metta),</i> kasina meditation, etc. By virtue of these attainments one will be reborn in the plane of the brahmas. The life-span of a brahma is very long and lasts for one world cycle, two, four, or eight world cycles, up to a limit of 84,000 world cycles, as the case may be. But at the end of his lifespan, a brahma will die and be reborn as a human being or a deva.</p>

    <p>If one leads a virtuous life all the time, one may lead a happy life in a higher existence, but as one is not free from the defilements of attachment, aversion and delusion, one may commit demeritorious deeds on many occasions. One will then be a victim of his bad karma and be reborn in hell or in other lower states of miserable existence. Thus mundane concentration also is not a definite security. It is desirable to work for supramundane concentration, the concentration of the path <i>(magga)</i> and the fruit <i>(phala).</i> To acquire this concentration it is essential to cultivate wisdom <i>(pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a).</i></p>

    <p>There are two forms of wisdom: mundane and supramundane. Nowadays, knowledge of literature, art, science, or other worldly affairs is usually regarded as a kind of wisdom, but this form of wisdom has nothing to do with any kind of mental development <i>(bhavana).</i> Nor can it be regarded as of real merit, because many weapons of destruction are invented through these kinds of knowledge, which are always under the influence of attachment, aversion, and other evil motives. The real spirit of mundane wisdom, on the other hand, has only merits and no demerits of any kind. True mundane wisdom includes the knowledge used in welfare and relief work, which causes no harm; learning to acquire the knowledge of the true meaning or sense of the scriptures; and the three classes of knowledge of development for insight <i>(vipassana-bhavana),</i> such as knowledge born of learning <i>(sutamaya-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a),</i> knowledge born of reflection <i>(cintamaya-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a),</i> and wisdom born of meditative development <i>(bhavanamaya-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a).</i> The virtue of possessing mundane wisdom will lead to a happy life in higher states of existence, but it still cannot prevent the risk of being reborn in hell or in other states of miserable existence. Only the development of supramundane wisdom <i>(lokuttara-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a)</i> can decidedly remove this risk.</p>

    <p>Supramundane wisdom is the wisdom of the path and fruit. To develop this wisdom it is necessary to carry on the practice of insight meditation <i>(vipassana-bhavana)</i> out of the three disciplines of morality, concentration, and wisdom. When the virtue of wisdom is duly developed, the necessary qualities of morality and concentration will also be acquired.</p>

    <h2 translation="发展智慧">The Development of Wisdom</h2>

    <p translation="发展智慧的方法，在于观察物质（rupa）和心识（nama）这两个人的基本方面，了解它们的真实本性。当前，依赖于仪器的物理实验尚不能研究心识。佛陀的方法不需要任何实验仪器，但可以同时了解物质和心识两个方面。该方法使用我们自己的心识，去单纯地觉知我们自身的物质和心识的活动过程。通过不间断地反复练习，获得必要的专注力，进而生动地感知到物质和心识的不间断地出现和消失。">The method of developing this wisdom is to observe materiality <i>(rupa)</i> and mentality <i>(nama)</i> &mdash; the two sole elements existing in a living being &mdash; with a view to knowing them in their true nature. At present, experiments in the analytical observation of materiality are usually carried out in laboratories with the aid of various kinds of instruments, yet these methods cannot deal with the mind. The method of the Buddha does not require any kind of instruments or outside aid. It can successfully deal with both materiality and mentality. It makes use of one's own mind for analytical purposes by fixing bare attention on the activities of materiality and mentality as they occur within oneself. By continually repeating this form of exercise, the necessary concentration can be gained, and when concentration is keen enough, the ceaseless course of arising and passing away of materiality and mentality will be vividly perceptible.</p>

    <p translation="人有两个不同的组成方面：物质和心识。身体属于物质，又可以细分为二十八个子类，但总地来说，身体是物质的。就像粘土或小麦做的玩偶一样，只不过是粘土或面粉的集合。物质遇冷、热等会改变自己的形态。由于这种易变性，在巴利文中被成为“rupa”。它不具备认识事物的能力。">The living being consists solely of the two distinct groups of materiality and mentality. The solid substance of body as it is now found belongs to the group of materiality. According to the usual enumeration of material phenomena, there are altogether twenty-eight kinds in this group, but in short it may be noted that body is a mass of materiality. For example, it is the same as a doll made of clay or wheat, which is nothing but a collection of particles of clay or flour. Materiality changes its form <i>(ruppati)</i> under physical conditions of heat, cold, etc., and because of this changeableness under contrary physical conditions, it is called <i>rupa</i> in Pali. It does not possess any faculty of knowing an object.</p>

    <p translation="在《Abhidhamma》中，心识被视为“有对象的状态”（sarammana-dhamma），物质被视为“无对象的状态”（anarammana-dhamma）。心识需要有对象，它附着在对象上，并认识该对象。而物质不需要对象，它不附着于某个对象上，不能够认识对象。由此可见，《Abhidhamma》认为物质不具备认识事物的能力。修习者也会有此体验。">In the Abhidhamma, the elements of mentality and materiality are classified as "states with object" <i>(sarammana-dhamma)</i> and "states without object" <i>(anarammana-dhamma),</i> respectively. The element of mentality has an object, holds an object, knows an object, while that of materiality does not have an object, does not hold an object, and does not know an object. It will thus be seen that the Abhidhamma has directly stated that materiality has no faculty of knowing an object. A yogi also perceives in like manner that "materiality has no faculty of knowing."</p>

    <p translation="木头柱子、砖块、石头和土块都是物质，它们不具备认识事物的能力。同样地，构成我们身体的物质也不具备。构成死人的物质与构成活人的物质同样都不能认识事物。然而，人们通常认为，活人的身体能够认识事物，这种能力在人死之后消失了。事实并非如此。实际上，不论活人死人，其身体物质都不具备认识事物的能力。">Logs and pillars, bricks and stones and lumps of earth are a mass of materiality. They do not possess any faculty of knowing. It is the same with the materiality which makes up a living body &mdash; it has no faculty of knowing. The materiality in a dead body is the same as that of a living body &mdash; it does not possess any faculty of knowing. People, however, have a common idea that the materiality of a living body possesses the faculty of knowing an object and that it loses this faculty only at death. This is not really so. In actual fact, materiality does not possess the faculty of knowing an object in either a dead or a living body.</p>

    <p translation="那么，能够认识事物的究竟是什么？是心识。在巴利文中，心识被称作“nama”，因为它滑向（namati）事物。心识也被称作“思想”或“意识”。心识的发生有赖于物质：视觉依赖眼睛，听觉依赖耳朵，嗅觉依赖鼻子，味觉依赖舌头，触觉依赖身体。有各种各样的触觉，有好的也有怀的。">What is it then that knows objects now? It is mentality, which comes into being depending on materiality. It is called <i>nama</i> in Pali because it inclines <i>(namati)</i> towards an object. Mentality is also spoken of as thought or consciousness. Mentality arises depending on materiality: depending on the eye, eye-consciousness (seeing) arises; depending on the ear, ear-consciousness (hearing) arises; depending on the nose, nose-consciousness (smelling) arises; depending on the tongue, tongue-consciousness (tasting) arises; depending on the body, body-consciousness (sense of touch) arises. There are many kinds of sense of touch, either good or bad.</p>

    <p translation="触觉的范围很广，遍布全身内外，而视觉、听觉、嗅觉和味觉则只出现在它们所处的固定部位上，即眼睛、耳朵、鼻子、舌头。这些知觉都是心识的运作。另外，还有思考、想法、想象等心理活动，它们依赖于大脑，也是心识的运作。心识能够认识事物，物质不能。">While touch has a wide field of action in running throughout the whole length of the body, inside and outside, the sense of seeing, hearing, smelling and tasting come into being in their own particular spheres &mdash; the eye, ear, nose and tongue &mdash; each of which occupies a very small and limited area of the body. These senses of touch, sight, etc., are nothing but the elements of mind. There also comes into being mind-consciousness &mdash; thoughts, ideas, imaginings, etc. &mdash; depending on the mind-base. All of these are elements of mind. Mind knows an object, while materiality does not know an object.</p>

    <h3 translation="看">Seeing</h3>

    <p translation="人们普遍认为，是眼睛看见事物，眼睛等同于看见。他们还认为：有一个“我”在看，“我“看见事物，“眼睛、看见和‘我’是同一的。”实际上不是这样。眼睛不等同于看见，也没有一个称为“我”或者“自我”的实体。事实只是，有眼睛所以能看见。">People generally believe that in the case of seeing, it is the eye which actually sees. They think that seeing and the eye are one and the same thing. They also think: "Seeing is I," "I see things," "The eye, seeing, and I are one and the same person." In reality this is not so. The eye is one thing and seeing is another, and there is no separate entity such as "I" or "ego." There is only the reality of seeing coming into being depending on the eye.</p>

    <p translation="正如一人坐在屋子里，屋子不是人本身，人也不是屋子本身。">To give an example, it is like the case of a person who sits in a house. The house and the person are two separate things: the house is not the person, nor is the person the house. Similarly, it is so at the time of seeing. The eye and seeing are two separate things: the eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye.</p>

    <p translation="同样地，眼睛不等同于看见。又如一人在屋内，透过窗子看向室外。如果问：“是窗子还是人在看？”答曰：“窗子无法看，只有人在看。”如果追问：“没有窗子的话，人还能看到外面吗？”答曰：“墙上无窗，则不能向外看。”同样地，眼睛不等同于看见，但没有眼睛，则不能看见事物。有眼睛所以能看见。">To give another example, it is just like the case of a person in a room who sees many things when he opens the window and looks through it. If it is asked, "Who is it that sees? Is it the window or the person that actually sees?" the answer is, "The window does not possess the ability to see; it is only the person who sees." If it is again asked, "Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window?" the answer will be, "It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window. One can only see through the window." Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye.</p>

    <p translation="每一个看的瞬间，都涉及（身体内部或外部的）所见之物、眼睛和视觉。前两者是物质上的，不具备了解事物的能力。第三个是心识上的，能够认识事物，知道它看起来像什么。所以，有物质和心识两个不同的方面，而所谓“看见”，正是物质——心识的结合。">It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality (eye) and mentality (seeing) at every moment of seeing. In addition, there is also a third element of materiality &mdash; the visual object. At times the visual object is noticeable in the body and at times it is noticeable outside the body. With the addition of the visual object there will then be three elements, two of which (the eye and the visual object) are materiality and the third of which (seeing) is mentality. The eye and the visual object, being materiality, do not possess the ability to know an object, while seeing, being mentality, can know the visual object and what it looks like. Now it is clear that there exist only the two separate elements of materiality and mentality at the moment of seeing, and the arising of this pair of separate elements is known as seeing.</p>

    <p translation="一个没有受到过内观训练、缺乏内观知识的人，会认为有一个“我”、“自我”、“一个活着的实体”或“一个人”，作为看的主体，以为是“我看到”或“我了解到”。这在巴利经典中被称为 sakkaya-ditthi。Sakkaya 的意思是“物质和心识”，ditthi 是“错误的认识”，所以合成词 sakkaya-ditthi 就是“对于物质和心识的错误认识”。">People who are without the training in and knowledge of insight meditation hold the view that seeing belongs to or is "self," "ego," "living entity," or "person." They believe that "seeing is I," or "I am seeing," or "I am knowing." This kind of view or belief is called <i>sakkaya-ditthi</i> in Pali. <i>Sakkaya</i> means the group of materiality <i>(rupa)</i> and mentality <i>(nama)</i> as they exist distinctively. <i>Ditthi</i> means a wrong view or belief. The compound word <i>sakkaya-ditthi</i> means a wrong view or belief in self with regard to <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa,</i> which exist in reality.</p>

    <p translation="进一步地，在每一个看的瞬间，都只有眼睛（物质）、所见之物（物质）和视觉（心识）。这里只有心识和物质，然而人们常常以为是我、自我或一个活着的实体在看，认为“我在看”、“在看的人是我”或“我看到自己的身体”。这个错误的认识将看的行为认同为我，是 sakkaya-ditthi。">For greater clarity, we will explain further the manner of holding the wrong view or belief. At the moment of seeing, the things which actually exist are the eye, the visual object (both materiality), and seeing (mentality). <i>Nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> are reality, yet people hold the view that this group of elements is self, or ego, or a living entity. They consider that "seeing is I," or "that which is seen is I," or "I see my own body." Thus this mistaken view is taking the simple act of seeing to be self, which is <i>sakkaya-ditthi,</i> the wrong view of self.</p>

    <p translation="只要有此错误认识，就会有脱坠入地狱的危险。虽然可以凭借自我的功德，暂时在人世或天界过着快乐的生活，但一有过失，便即刻坠入恶境。因此佛陀指出，必须要根除我执：">As long as one is not free from the wrong view of self, one cannot expect to escape from the risk of falling into the miserable realms of the hells, the animals or the petas. Though one may be leading a happy life in the human or deva world by virtue of one's merits, yet one is liable to fall back into the miserable states of existence at any time, when one's demerits operate. For this reason, the Buddha pointed out that it is essential to work for the total removal of the wrong view of self:</p>

    <blockquote translation="“比丘正念前行，舍弃我见。”<br />(sakkaya-ditthippahañaya sato bhikkhu paribbaje).">
    "Let a monk go forth mindfully to abandon view of self"<br />
    <i>(sakkaya-ditthippaha&ntilde;aya sato bhikkhu paribbaje).</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p translation="人人都想摆脱生老病死，可无人能幸免。死后还有重生。根据我们的所作所为，或重生入地狱，或重生为动物，我们无从选择。所以，生死轮回非常可怕。应尽一切努力认识、脱离轮回，获得解脱。">To explain: though it is the wish of everyone to avoid old age, disease and death, no one can prevent their inevitable arrival. After death, rebirth follows. Rebirth in any state of existence does not depend on one's own wish. It is not possible to avoid rebirth in the hell realm, the animal realm or the realm of the petas by merely wishing for an escape. Rebirth takes place in any state of existence as the consequence of one's own deeds: there is no choice at all. For these reasons, the round of birth and death, <i>samsara,</i> is very dreadful. Every effort should therefore be made to acquaint oneself with the miserable conditions of samsara, and then to work for an escape from samsara, for the attainment of Nibbana.</p>

    <p translation="如果不能摆脱轮回，至少应努力避免重生入恶境。Sakkaya-ditthi 是重生入恶境的根本原因，应彻底根除。只有通过圣道，即品德、专注和智慧，才能脱离 sakkaya-ditthi。所以应当发展品德、专注和智慧。如何做？通过觉知 [note or observe]，我们摆脱烦恼（kilesa）。应当在每一所见所闻（等等）处，不断地觉知物质—心识过程，直到从对物质和心识的错误认识之中解脱出来为止。">If an escape from samsara as a whole is not possible for the present, an attempt should be made for an escape at least from the round of rebirth in the hell realms, the animal realm and the peta realm. In this case it is necessary to work for the total removal within oneself of <i>sakkaya-ditthi,</i> which is the root cause of rebirth in the miserable states of existence. <i>Sakkaya-ditthi</i> can only be destroyed completely by the noble path and fruit: the three supramundane virtues of morality, concentration and wisdom. It is therefore imperative to work for the development of these virtues. How should one do the work? By means of noting or observing one must go out from the jurisdiction of defilements <i>(kilesa).</i> One should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of seeing, hearing, etc., which are the constituent physical and mental processes, till one is freed from <i>sakkaya-ditthi,</i> the wrong view of self.</p>

    <p translation="因此，这里讲内观冥想 [vipassana meditation]，为了让有意者在比较短的时间内，完成练习，获得圣道，彻底根除 sakkaya-ditthi，避免重入恶境。">For these reasons advice is always given here to take up the practice of vipassana meditation. Now yogis have come here for the purpose of practicing vipassana meditation who may be able to complete the course of training and attain the noble path in no long time. The view of self will then be totally removed and security will be finally gained against the danger of rebirth in the realms of the hells, animals and petas.</p>

    <p translation="所谓练习，就是在每次看的时候，觉知“看”。“觉知” ['note' or 'observe' or
    'contemplate'] 的意思是，将注意力固定在对象上，以清楚地认识它。">In this respect, the exercise is simply to note or observe the existing elements in every act of seeing. It should be noted as "seeing, seeing" on every occasion of seeing. By the terms "note" or "observe" or "contemplate" is meant the act of keeping the mind fixedly on the object with a view to knowing it clearly.</p>

    <p translation="于是，在每次看的时候，我们都注意到所见之物、看事物的眼睛和看的意识。如果不能注意到这三者，则会产生 sakkaya-ditthi，我们会认为是一个人，一个永恒、愉快的自我在看。于是产生贪恋和欲望，进而产生行为。如此不断往复，无有尽时。为了跳出轮回，必须要在每次看的时候，觉知“看、看”。">When this is done, and the act of seeing is noted as "seeing, seeing," at times the visual object is noticed, at times consciousness of seeing is noticed, at times the eye-base, the place from which one sees, is noticed. It will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly any one of the three. If not, based on this act of seeing there will arise <i>sakkaya-ditthi,</i> which will view it in the form of a person or as belonging to a person, and as being permanent, pleasurable, and self. This will arouse the defilements of craving and attachment, which will in turn prompt deeds, and the deeds will bring forth rebirth in a new existence. Thus the process of dependent origination operates and the vicious circle of samsara revolves incessantly. In order to prevent the revolving of samsara from this source of seeing, it is necessary to note "seeing, seeing" on every occasion of seeing.</p>

    <h3 translation="听及其它">Hearing, Etc.</h3>

    <p translation="对于听来说，同样有物质和心识两个部分，有耳朵所以有听。耳朵和声音是其物质部分。听觉是其心识部分。为了清楚了解物质——心识，每次听的时候，都应觉知“听、听”。同样地，闻的时候，觉知“闻、闻”；尝的时候，觉知“尝、尝”。">Similarly, in the case of hearing, there are only two distinct elements, materiality and mentality. The sense of hearing arises depending on the ear. While the ear and sound are two elements of materiality, the sense of hearing is the element of mentality. In order to know clearly any one of these two kinds of materiality and mentality, every occasion of hearing should be noted as "hearing, hearing." So also, "smelling, smelling" should be noted on every occasion of smelling, and "tasting, tasting" on every occasion of tasting.</p>

    <p translation="身体的感觉也是一样。触碰东西的时候，会有触感，这是物质部分。从这种触感中，我们感知到身体触碰了什么东西。所以，每次触碰的时候，都会有物质——心识两方面：身体的触感和被触碰的物体是物质方面，感知到触碰是心识方面。">The sensation of touch in the body should be noted in the very same way. There is a kind of material element known as bodily sensitivity throughout the body, which receives every impression of touch. Every kind of touch, either agreeable or disagreeable, usually comes in contact with bodily sensitivity, and from this there arises body-consciousness, which feels or knows the touch on each occasion. It will now be seen that at every moment of touching there are two elements of materiality &mdash; the bodily sensitivity and the tangible object &mdash; and one element of mentality &mdash; knowing of touch.</p>

    <p translation="为了清楚了解物质——心识，应当练习觉知“接触、接触”。这仅涉及一般形式的触觉。有时身体伴随着疼痛或其它负面感觉，例如身体四肢僵硬、疲倦，感觉热、疼痛、麻木等等。在这些情况中，感觉（vedana）占主导，所以应当视情况而觉知“感觉热”、“感觉累”、“感觉痛”等等。">In order to know these things distinctly at every moment of touching, the practice of noting as "touching, touching" has to be carried out. This merely refers to the common form of sensation of touch. There are special forms which accompany painful or disagreeable sensations, such as feeling stiffness or tiredness in the body or limbs, feeling hot, pain, numb, aches, etc. Because feeling <i>(vedana)</i> predominates in these cases, it should be noted as "feeling hot," "feeling tired," "feeling painful," etc., as the case may be.</p>

    <p translation="在每次弯曲、拉伸或移动身体的时候，会产生很多感觉。因为有想要移动、拉伸或弯曲的意图，然后有身体的移动、拉伸或弯曲。（只有经历一段时间的练习，才能注意到这些。）所有活动都有赖于心识。心想要弯曲，于是产生一系列的手脚的向内移动。心想要拉伸或移动，于是产生一系列的向外或来回的移动。心识活动转瞬即逝，过后才被注意到。">It may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of touch in the hands, the legs, and so on, on each occasion of bending, stretching, or moving. Because of mentality wanting to move, stretch or bend, the material activities of moving, stretching or bending, etc., occur in series. (It may not be possible to notice these incidents at the outset. They can only be noticed after some time, on gaining experience by practice. It is mentioned here for the sake of general information.) All activities in movements and in changing, etc., are done by mentality. When mentality wills to bend, there arises a series of inward movements of hand or the leg. When mentality wills to stretch or move, there arises a series of outward movements or movements to and fro. They fall away soon after they occur and at the very point of occurrence, as one will notice later.</p>

    <p translation="每次做弯曲、伸展或其它身体活动时，首先有想要活动的意念，这是心识部分。它使手脚产生一系列的活动，例如，紧绷、弯曲、伸展或来回移动，这是物质部分。这些活动进一步导致更多的身体接触和对触觉的感知。在这些情况中，身体活动是主导的，应当注意到它们。否则，必会产生错误的认知，以为一个“我”在活动：“我在弯曲”、“我在拉伸”、“我的手”或“我的腿”。为了根除这些错误认知，应当觉知“弯曲”、“拉伸”、“移动”。">In every case of bending, stretching, or other activities, there arises first a series of intentions, moments of mentality, inducing or causing in the hands and legs a series of material activities, such as stiffening, bending, stretching, or moving to and fro. These activities come up against other material elements, the bodily sensitivity, and on every occasion of contact between material activities and sensitive qualities, there arises body-consciousness, which feels or knows the sensation of touch. It is therefore clear that material activities are predominating factors in these cases. It is necessary to notice the predominating factors. If not, there will surely arise the wrong view which regards these activities as the doings of an "I" &mdash; "I am bending," "I am stretching," "my hands," or "my legs." This practice of noting as "bending," "stretching," "moving," is carried out for the purpose of removing such wrong views.</p>

    <h3 translation="心理活动">Mind</h3>

    <p translation="因为有引发心理活动的事物 [mind-base]，所以有心理活动，例如思考、想象或言语。每一种心理活动，都伴随着物质和心识两个部分。引发心理活动的事物是物质部分，思考、想象等等是心识部分。为了能够清楚地了解物质——心识，应觉知“思考”、“想象”等等。">Depending on the mind-base there arises a series of mental activities, such as thinking, imagining, etc., or generally speaking, a series of mental activities arises depending on the body. In reality, each case is a composition of mentality and materiality, mind-base being materiality, and thinking, imagining, and so forth being mentality. In order to be able to notice materiality and mentality clearly, "thinking," "imagining," and so forth should be noted in each case.</p>

    <p translation="如此练习一段时间后，专注力会提升，注意力会固定在它所指向的对象上，而不会分心。同时，觉知能力也会提升，能够注意到对象和一同出现的觉知的心。">After having carried out the practice in the manner indicated above for some time, there may be an improvement in concentration. One will notice that the mind no longer wanders about but remains fixed on the object to which it is directed. At the same time, the power of noticing has considerably developed. On every occasion of noting, one notices only two processes of materiality and mentality: a dual set of object (materiality) and mental state (mentality), which makes note of the object, arising together.</p>

    <p translation="进一步练习，我们会注意到，万事万物不断出现又消失。每一个时刻，新的事物出现，这时我们能够觉知到它。紧接着它立即消失，然后另一个事物出现。再一次地，它被我们觉知到并即刻消失。借由觉知，我们了解到事物不是恒常的。也就是洞见无常（aniccanupassana-ñana）。
    ">Again, on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation, after some time one notices that nothing remains permanent, but that everything is in a state of flux. New things arise each time. Each of them is noted as it arises. Whatever arises then passes away immediately and immediately another arises, which is again noted and which then passes away. Thus the process of arising and passing away goes on, which clearly shows that nothing is permanent. One therefore realizes that "things are not permanent" because one sees that they arise and pass away immediately. This is insight into impermanence <i>(aniccanupassana-&ntilde;ana).</i></p>

    <p translation="进一步，我们认识到“事物出现又消失，这不是我们所希望的”，也就是洞见苦（dukkhanupassana-ñana）。此外，还会经常觉知到身体中不舒服的感觉，例如疲倦、热、疼痛。在觉知到这些感觉的时候，我们会认为身体是苦的集合，这也是对苦的洞察。">Then one also realizes that "arising and passing are not desirable." This is insight into suffering <i>(dukkhanupassana-&ntilde;ana).</i> Besides, one usually experiences many painful sensations in the body, such as tiredness, heat, aching, and at the time of noting these sensations, one generally feels that this body is a collection of sufferings. This is also insight into suffering.</p>

    <p translation="进一步，通过不间断地觉知，会发现物质——心识过程的发生，有赖于它们的本性和先决条件，而不取决于我们的意志。于是，我们认识到“它们是不可控的，它们不是一个人或活着的实体”。也就是洞见无我（anattanupassana-ñana）。">Then at every time of noting it is found that elements of materiality and mentality occur according to their respective nature and conditioning, and not according to one's wishes. One therefore realizes that "they are elements; they are not governable; they are not a person or living entity." This is insight into non-self <i>(anattanupassana-&ntilde;ana).</i></p>

    <p translation="在获得了对无常、苦和无我的洞察之后，[the maturity of knowledge of the path (magga-ñana) and knowledge of fruition (phala-ñana) takes place and] 便证悟涅槃。通过证悟最初阶段的涅槃，我们从重生入恶境的轮回中解脱出来。各位当努力达到这一最初阶段，它提供了最低限度的保护，防止我们陷入轮回。">On having fully acquired these insights into impermanence, suffering, and non-self, the maturity of knowledge of the path <i>(magga-&ntilde;ana)</i> and knowledge of fruition <i>(phala-&ntilde;ana)</i> takes place and realization of Nibbana is won. By winning the realization of Nibbana in the first stage, one is freed from the round of rebirth in the realms of miserable existence. Everyone should therefore endeavor to reach the first stage, the path and fruit of stream-entry, as a minimum measure of protection against an unfortunate rebirth.</p>

    <h2 translation="入门练习">The Beginner's Exercise</h2>

    <p translation="如前所述，练习内观冥想的方法，是觉知接连发生的看、听、闻、尝、触碰和心理活动。然而，对于初学者来说，正念（sati）、专注力（samadhi）和智慧 [knowledge]（ñana）仍有所不足，无法觉知所有的过程。看、听、闻、尝、触碰和心理活动发生得非常迅速，以至于像是同时发生的，无法觉知到谁先谁后。">It has already been explained that the actual method of practice in vipassana meditation is to note, or to observe, or to contemplate, the successive occurrences of seeing, hearing, and so on, at the six sense doors. However, it will not be possible for a beginner to follow these on all successive incidents as they occur because his mindfulness <i>(sati),</i> concentration <i>(samadhi),</i> and knowledge <i>(&ntilde;ana)</i> are still very weak. The moments of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking occur very swiftly. It seems that seeing occurs at the same time as hearing, that hearing occurs at the same time as seeing, that seeing and hearing occur simultaneously, that seeing, hearing, thinking and imagining always occur simultaneously. Because they occur so swiftly, it is not possible to distinguish which occurs first and which second.</p>

    <p translation="实际上，看和听不能同时。初学者还没有充分发展正念、专注力和智慧，无法觉知到它们其实是相续发生的。所以，对于初学者而言，不必强求觉知到很多事物，而应当从少数事物入手。">In reality, seeing does not occur at the same time as hearing, nor does hearing occur at the same time as seeing. Such incidents can occur only one at a time. A yogi who has just begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed his mindfulness, concentration and knowledge will not, however, be in a position to observe all these moments singly as they occur in serial order. A beginner need not, therefore, follow up on many things. He needs to begin with only a few things.</p>

    <p translation="只有当我们注意某物的时候，才会看见或听到。如果没有对景物或声音给予注意，便不会看到或听到。我们很少注意到嗅觉。而味觉只有在品尝事物时才会出现。当看、听、闻和尝发生时，练习者要觉知它们。然而，身体的触觉一直都存在，并总是很明显。例如坐着的时候，可以明显感到身体的僵直或座位的硬度。因此，注意力应当放在坐姿上，并觉知“坐”。">Seeing or hearing occurs only when due attention is given to their objects. If one does not pay heed to any sight or sound, one may pass the time without any moments of seeing or hearing taking place. Smelling rarely occurs. The experience of tasting can only occur while one is eating. In the case of seeing, hearing, smelling and tasting, the yogi can note them when they occur. Body impressions, however, are ever present. They usually exist distinctly all the time. During the time that one is sitting, the body impression of stiffness or the sensation of hardness in this position is distinctly felt. Attention should therefore be fixed on the sitting posture and a note made as "sitting, sitting, sitting."</p>

    <h3 translation="坐">Sitting</h3>

    <p translation="坐时身体保持挺直，它是由一系列心识活动而引发的身体活动。正如气球因为内部充满空气而保持圆形，身体因为连续的活动而保持挺直。要把沉重的身躯拉直并保持挺拔，需要很多力气。人们通常认为，是肌肉使身体保持挺直。某种意义上说，这是对的，因为肌肉、血液、皮肤和骨骼仅仅是物质的，使身体保持挺直的元素属于物质，它在肌肉、血液等等里面，遍布周身，如气球中的空气一般。">Sitting is an erect posture of the body consisting of a series of physical activities, induced by consciousness consisting of a series of mental activities. It is just like the case of an inflated rubber ball which maintains its round shape through the resistance of the air inside it. The posture of sitting is similar in that the body is kept in an erect posture through the continuous process of physical activities. A good deal of energy is required to pull up and keep in an erect position such a heavy load as this body. People generally assume that the body is lifted and kept in an upright position by means of sinews. This assumption is correct in a sense because sinews, blood, flesh and bones are nothing but materiality. The element of stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the group of materiality and arises in the sinews, flesh, blood, etc., throughout the body, like the air in a rubber ball.</p>

    <p translation="使事物保持形状的，是空气元素，即 vayo-dhatu。空气元素使身体保持挺直。在睡眠或困倦时，保持身体挺直的能量被切断了，因此身体平躺。这种状态被称为 bhavanga，即“生命连续体”或被动潜意识流。这时，心识活动停止了，因此身体平躺。">The element of stiffening is the air element, known as <i>vayo-dhatu.</i> The body is kept in an erect position by the air element in the form of stiffening, which is continually coming into existence. At the time of sleepiness or drowsiness, one may drop flat because the supply of new materials in the form of stiffening is cut off. The state of mind in heavy drowsiness or sleep is <i>bhavanga,</i> the "life-continuum" or passive subconscious flow. During the course of bhavanga, mental activities are absent, and for this reason, the body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsiness.</p>

    <p translation="清醒时，强烈而警觉的心识活动不断发生，进而不断产生空气元素，使身体挺直。要了解这些事实，需要主动觉知身体姿势，“坐、坐、坐”。这不是说要特意寻找和觉知身体挺直的感觉。只需要将注意坐姿整体，即下半身弯曲上半身保持挺直。">During waking hours, strong and alert mental activities are continually arising, and because of these the air element arises serially in the form of stiffening. In order to know these facts, it is essential to note the bodily posture attentively as "sitting, sitting, sitting." This does not necessarily mean that the body impression of stiffening should particularly be searched for and noted. Attention need only be fixed on the whole form of the sitting posture, that is, the lower portion of the body in a bent circular form and the upper portion held erect.</p>

    <p translation="对修习者来说，仅仅练习观察坐姿太容易了。这时，精力（viriya）太少而注意力集中（samadhi）有余，容易感到昏沉、乏味，不愿继续练习觉知“坐、坐、坐”。当注意力过于集中但精力不济时，就会产生昏沉，一种懒惰麻木的状态。">It may be found that the exercise of observing the mere sitting posture is too easy and does not require much effort. In these circumstances, energy <i>(viriya)</i> is less and concentration <i>(samadhi)</i> is in excess. One will generally feel lazy and will not want to carry on the noting as "sitting, sitting, sitting" repeatedly for a considerable length of time. Laziness generally occurs when there is an excess of concentration and not enough energy. It is nothing but a state of sloth and torpor <i>(thina-middha).</i></p>

    <p translation="为了获得更多精力，需要扩大觉知的范围。在觉知“坐”之后，注意身体上有触觉的地方，并觉知“接触”。任何腿上、手上或臀部有明显触觉的地方，都可以作为目标。例如，在觉知坐姿为“坐”之后，觉知有触觉的地方为“接触”，如此反复，“坐、接触、坐、接触、坐、接触”。">More energy should be developed, and for this purpose, the number of objects for noting should be increased. After noting as "sitting," the attention should be directed to a spot in the body where the sense of touch is felt and a note made as "touching." Any spot in the leg or hand or hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purpose. For example, after noting the sitting posture of the body as "sitting," the spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as "touching." The noting should thus be repeated using these two objects of <i>the sitting posture</i> and <i>the place of touching</i> alternately, as "sitting, touching, sitting, touching, sitting, touching."</p>

    <p translation="“觉知”意指将注意力固定在一个对象上。这个练习就是简单地觉知“坐、接触”。有经验的修习者会觉得这个练习简单，而初学者会觉得很难。">The terms "noting," "observing" and "contemplating" are used here to indicate the fixing of attention on an object. The exercise is simply to note or observe or contemplate as "sitting, touching." Those who already have experience in the practice of meditation may find this exercise easy to begin with, but those without any previous experience may at first find it rather difficult.</p>

    <h3 translation="起伏">Rising-Falling</h3>

    <p translation="一个更简单容易的练习是觉知伴随着每一次呼吸的腹部起伏，初学者应当由此入手，开始练习。这是因为腹部的起伏相对更明显，更容易感知得到。正如在学校里，我们从简单的课程开始学习，内观冥想也是如此。初学者会发现，从简单容易的练习入手，更容易发展专注力和智慧。">A simpler and easier form of the exercise for a beginner is this: With every breath there occurs in the abdomen a rising-falling movement. A beginner should start with the exercise of noting this movement. This rising-falling movement is easy to observe because it is coarse and therefore more suitable for the beginner. As in schools where simple lessons are easy to learn, so also is the practice of vipassana meditation. A beginner will find it easier to develop concentration and knowledge with a simple and easy exercise.</p>

    <p translation="内观冥想要从显著对象入手。对于心识和物质这两方面，前者精微而不显著，后者粗糙而明显。因此，在一开始，通常从物质方面的对象入手。">Again, the purport of vipassana meditation is to begin the exercise by contemplating prominent factors in the body. Of the two factors of mentality and materiality, the former is subtle and less prominent, while the latter is coarse and more prominent. At the outset, therefore, the usual procedure for an insight meditator is to begin the exercise by contemplating the material elements.</p>

    <p translation="关于物质方面，衍生物质是精微而不显著的，而四个基本的物质元素（maha-bhuta-rupa）——土、水、火和空气，是粗糙且明显的，因此是首要的练习对象。腹部起伏就是以空气元素（vayo-dhatu）主导的。可见，在一开始，空气元素是能够被感知得到的。">With regard to materiality, it may be mentioned here that derived materiality <i>(upada-rupa)</i> is subtle and less prominent, while the four primary physical elements <i>(maha-bhuta-rupa)</i> &mdash; earth, water, fire and air &mdash; are coarse and more prominent. The latter should therefore have priority in the order of objects for contemplation. In the case of rising-falling, the outstanding factor is the air element, or <i>vayo-dhatu.</i> The process of stiffening and the movements of the abdomen noticed during the contemplation are nothing but the functions of the air element. Thus it will be seen that the air element is perceptible at the beginning.</p>

    <p translation="根据《念住经》，行走时修习者应当觉知行走，站立时觉知站立，坐下时觉知坐下，躺下时觉知躺下。也应当觉知其它正在发生的身体活动。其注释中讲到，相对于其它三种基本元素，修习者应当以空气元素作为主要的觉知对象。实际上，所有四种基本元素都参与了身体活动，因此需要觉知到每一种。坐着的时候，伴随着每一次呼吸，有明显的腹部起伏，初学者应当以此为觉知的对象。">According to the instructions of the Satipatthana Sutta, one should be mindful of the activities of walking while walking, of those of standing, sitting and lying down while standing, sitting and lying down, respectively. One should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each of them occurs. In this connection, it is stated in the commentaries that one should be mindful primarily of the air element, in preference to the other three elements. As a matter of fact, all four primary elements are dominant in every action of the body, and it is essential to perceive any one of them. At the time of sitting, either of the two movements of rising and falling occurs conspicuously with every breath, and a beginning should be made by noting these movements.</p>

    <p translation="现在我们了解了系统性的内观冥想的本质，接下来讨论基本的练习纲要。">Some fundamental features in the system of vipassana meditation have been explained for general information. The general outline of basic exercises will now be dealt with.</p>

    <h3 translation="基本练习纲要">Outline of Basic Exercises</h3>

    <p translation="觉知腹部起伏时，修习者应把注意力保持在腹部上。他知道吸气时腹部扩张，呼气时腹部收缩。扩张时应觉知“起”，收缩时应觉知“伏”。如果不能清楚地觉知腹部起伏，可以将手放在腹部。">When contemplating rising and falling, the disciple should keep his mind on the abdomen. He will then come to know the upward movement or expansion of the abdomen on breathing in, and the downward movement or contraction on breathing out. A mental note should be made as "rising" for the upward movement and "falling" for the downward movement. If these movements are not clearly noticed by simply fixing the mind on them, one or both hands should be placed on the abdomen.</p>

    <p translation="修习者应保持呼吸自然。不要有意识地减缓或加快呼吸，也不要有意识地进行深呼吸。如果改变呼吸自然的节律，很快就会感到筋疲力尽。因此，修习者应保持呼吸自然，并觉知腹部起伏。">The disciple should not try to change the manner of his natural breathing. He should neither attempt slow breathing by the retention of his breath, nor quick breathing or deep breathing. If he does change the natural flow of his breathing, he will soon tire himself. He must therefore keep to the natural rate of his breathing and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling.</p>

    <p translation="腹部扩张时觉知“起”，腹部收缩时觉知“伏”。觉知时不必出声。在内观冥想中，重要的是觉知事物，而不是知道它们名字。因此，修习者应努力做到觉知腹部扩张和收缩的整个过程，从开始到结束，就像用眼睛观看一样。腹部扩张发生时，觉知的心应紧紧跟随，如石击壁。腹部扩张的运动和觉知该运动的心应保持同时同步。同样地，腹部的收缩运动和觉知该运动的心应保持同时同步。">On the occurrence of the upward movement of the abdomen, the mental note of "rising" should be made, and on the downward movement of the abdomen, the mental note of "falling" should be made. The mental notation of these terms should not be vocalized. In vipassana meditation, it is more important to know the object than to know it by a term or name. It is therefore necessary for the disciple to make every effort to be mindful of the movement of rising from its beginning to its end and that of falling from its beginning to its end, as if these movements are actually seen with the eyes. As soon as rising occurs, there should be the knowing mind close to the movement, as in the case of a stone hitting a wall. The movement of rising as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion. Similarly, the movement of falling as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion.</p>

    <p translation="如果没有其它明显的事物，修习者不应间断觉知腹部起伏的练习。然而，在练习的过程中，思绪可能会四处游走。在专注力还比较弱的时候，控制心识是很难的。尽管已经将注意力放在了腹部起伏上，但它不会老实地待在那里，而是会走神，飘到其它地方。应当觉知走神的心，在察觉到走神时，觉知“走神、走神、走神”。通常注意力很快便停止游荡，这时应继续觉知腹部起伏的练习。当察觉到心抵达了某处，应觉知“抵达、抵达、抵达”，然后回到觉知腹部起伏的练习。">When there is no other conspicuous object, the disciple should carry on the exercise of noting these two movements as "rising, falling, rising, falling, rising, falling." While thus being occupied with this exercise, there may be occasions when the mind wanders about. When concentration is weak, it is very difficult to control the mind. Though it is directed to the movements of rising and falling, the mind will not stay with them but will wander to other places. This wandering mind should not be let alone. It should be noted as "wandering, wandering, wandering" as soon as it is noticed that it is wandering. On noting once or twice the mind usually stops wandering, then the exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued. When it is again found that the mind has reached a place, it should be noted as "reaching, reaching, reaching." Then the exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be reverted to as soon as these movements are clear.</p>

    <p translation="在想象中与人会面时，应觉知“会面、会面、会面”，紧接着回到通常的练习上。与想象中的人对话时，应觉知“对话、对话”。目的在于觉知每一处心理活动。例如，思考的时候觉知“思考”，或者觉知“沉思”、“计划”、“知道”、“想要”、“欣喜”、“感觉疲倦”、“感觉愉快”、“厌恶”等等。在巴利文中，觉知心理活动被称作“cittanupassana”，即“对心的觉知”。">On meeting with a person in the imagination, it should be noted as "meeting, meeting," after which the usual exercise should be reverted to. Sometimes the fact that it is mere imagination is discovered when one speaks with that imaginary person, and it should then be noted as "speaking,speaking." The real purport is to note every mental activity as it occurs. For instance, it should be noted as "thinking" at the moment of thinking, and as "reflecting," "planning," "knowing," "attending," rejoicing," "feeling lazy," "feeling happy," "disgusted," etc., as the case may be, on the occurrence of each activity. The contemplation of mental activities and noticing them is called <i>cittanupassana,</i> contemplation of mind.</p>

    <p>Because people have no practical knowledge in vipassana meditation, they are generally not in a position to know the real state of the mind. This naturally leads them to the wrong view of holding mind to be "person," "self," "living entity." They usually believe that "imagination is I," "I am thinking, " "I am planning," "I am knowing," and so forth. They hold that there exists a living entity or self which grows up from childhood to adulthood. In reality, such a living entity does not exist, but there does exist a continuous process of elements of mind which occur singly, one at a time, in succession. The practice of contemplation is therefore being carried out with the aim of discovering the true nature of this mind-body complex.</p>

    <p>As regards the mind and the manner of its arising, the Buddha stated in the Dhammapada (v.37):</p>

    <blockquote>
    <i>Durangamam ekacaram<br />
    asariram guhasayam<br />
    ye cittam sa&ntilde;&ntilde;amessanti<br />
    mokkhanti marabandhana.</i>
    <p>Faring far, wandering alone,<br />
    Formless and lying in a cave.<br />
    Those who do restrain the mind<br />
    Are sure released from Mara's bonds.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Faring far.</i> Mind usually wanders far and wide. While the yogi is trying to carry on with the practice of contemplation in his meditation room, he often finds that his mind has wandered to many far-off places, towns, etc. He also finds that his mind can wander to any of the far-off places which he has previously known at the very moment of thinking or imagining. This fact is discovered with the help of contemplation.</p>

    <p><i>Alone.</i> Mind occurs singly, moment to moment in succession. Those who do not perceive the reality of this believe that one mind exists in the course of life or existence. They do not know that new minds are always arising at every moment. They think that the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thinking of the past and of the present belong to one and the same mind, and that three or four acts of seeing, hearing, touching, knowing usually occur simultaneously.</p>

    <p>These are wrong views. In reality, single moments of mind arise and pass away continuously, one after another. This can be perceived on gaining considerable practice. The cases of imagination and planning are clearly perceptible. Imagination passes away as soon as it is noted as "imagining, imagining," and planning also passes away as soon as it is noted as "planning, planning." These instances of arising, noting and passing away appear like a string of beads. The preceding mind is not the following mind. Each is separate. These characteristics of reality are personally perceptible, and for this purpose one must proceed with the practice of contemplation.</p>

    <p><i>Formless.</i> Mind has no substance, no form. It is not easy to distinguish as is the case with materiality. In the case of materiality, the body, head, hands and legs are very prominent and are easily noticed. If it is asked what matter is, matter can be handled and shown. Mind, however, is not easy to describe because it has no substance or form. For this reason, it is not possible to carry out analytical laboratory experiments on the mind.</p>

    <p>One can, however, fully understand the mind if it is explained as <i>that which knows an object.</i> To understand the mind, it is necessary to contemplate the mind at every moment of its occurrence. When contemplation is fairly advanced, the mind's approach to its object is clearly comprehended. It appears as if each moment of mind is making a direct leap towards it object. In order to know the true nature of the mind, contemplation is thus prescribed.</p>

    <p><i>Lying in a cave.</i> Because the mind comes into being depending on the mind-base and the other sense doors situated in the body, it is said that it rests in a cave.</p>

    <p><i>Those who do restrain the mind are sure released from Mara's bonds.</i> It is said that the mind should be contemplated at each moment of its occurrence. The mind can thus be controlled by means of contemplation. On his successful controlling of the mind, the yogi will win freedom from the bondage of Mara, the King of Death. It will now be seen that it is important to note the mind at every moment of its occurrence. As soon as it is noted, the mind passes away. For instance, by noting once or twice as "intending, intending," it is found that intention passes away at once. Then the usual exercise of noting as "rising, falling, rising, falling" should be reverted to.</p>

    <p>While one is proceeding with the usual exercise, one may feel that one wants to swallow saliva. It should be noted as "wanting," and on gathering saliva as "gathering," and on swallowing as "swallowing," in the serial order of occurrence. The reason for contemplation in this case is because there may be a persisting personal view as "wanting to swallow is I," "swallowing is also I." In reality, "wanting to swallow" is mentality and not "I," and "swallowing" is materiality and not "I." There exist only mentality and materiality at that moment. By means of contemplating in this manner, one will understand clearly the process of reality. So too, in the case of spitting, it should be noted as "wanting" when one wants to spit, as "bending" on bending the neck (which should be done slowly), as "looking, seeing" on looking and as "spitting" on spitting. Afterwards, the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued.</p>

    <p>Because of sitting for a long time, there will arise in the body unpleasant feeling of being stiff, being hot and so forth. These sensations should be noted as they occur. The mind should be fixed on that spot and a note made as "stiff, stiff" on feeling stiff, as "hot, hot" on feeling hot, as "painful, painful" on feeling painful, as "prickly, prickly" on feeling prickly sensations, and as "tired, tired" on feeling tired. These unpleasant feelings are <i>dukkha-vedana</i> and the contemplation of these feeling is <i>vedananupassana,</i> contemplation of feeling.</p>

    <p>Owing to the absence of knowledge in respect of these feelings, there persists the wrong view of holding them as one's own personality or self, that is to say, "I am feeling stiff," "I am feeling painful," "I was feeling well formerly but I now feel uncomfortable," in the manner of a single self. In reality, unpleasant feelings arise owing to disagreeable impressions in the body. Like the light of an electric bulb which can continue to burn on a continuous supply of energy, so it is in the case of feelings, which arise anew on every occasion of coming in contact with disagreeable impressions.</p>

    <p>It is essential to understand these feelings clearly. At the beginning of noting as "stiff, stiff," "hot, hot," "painful, painful," one may feel that such disagreeable feelings grow stronger, and then one will notice that a mind wanting to change the posture arises. This mind should be noted as "wanting, wanting." Then a return should be made to the feeling and it should be noted as "stiff, stiff" or "hot, hot," and so forth. If one proceeds in this manner of contemplation with great patience, unpleasant feelings will pass away.</p>

    <p>There is a saying that patience leads to Nibbana. Evidently this saying is more applicable in the case of contemplation than in any other. Plenty of patience is needed in contemplation. If a yogi cannot bear unpleasant feelings with patience, but frequently changes his posture during contemplation, he cannot expect to gain concentration. Without concentration there is no chance of acquiring insight knowledge <i>(vipassana-&ntilde;ana)</i> and without insight knowledge the attainment of the path, fruition and Nibbana cannot be won.</p>

    <p>Patience is of great importance in contemplation. Patience is needed mostly to bear unpleasant bodily feelings. There is hardly any case of outside disturbances where it is necessary to exercise patience. This means the observance of <i>khantisamvara,</i> restraint by patience. The posture should not be immediately changed when unpleasant sensations arise, but contemplation should be continued by noting them as "stiff, stiff," "hot, hot," and so on. Such painful sensations are normal and will pass away. In the case of strong concentration, it will be found that great pains will pass away when they are noted with patience. On the fading away of suffering or pain, the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it may be found that pains or unpleasant feelings do not immediately pass away even when one notes them with great patience. In such a case, one has no alternative but to change posture. One must, of course, submit to superior forces. When concentration is not strong enough, strong pains will not pass away quickly. In these circumstances there will often arise a mind wanting to change posture, and this mind should be noted as "wanting, wanting." After this, one should note "lifting, lifting" on moving it forward.</p>

    <p>These bodily actions should be carried out slowly, and these slow movements should be followed up and noted as "lifting, lifting," "moving, moving," "touching, touching," in the successive order of the process. Again, on moving one should note "moving, moving," and on putting down, note "putting, putting." If, when this process of changing posture has been completed, there is nothing more to be noted, the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued.</p>

    <p>There should be no stop or break in between. The preceding act of noting and the one which follows should be contiguous. Similarly, the preceding concentration and the one which follows should be contiguous, and the preceding act of knowing and the one which follows should be contiguous. In this way, the gradual development by stages of mindfulness, concentration and knowledge takes place, and depending on their full development, the final stage of path-knowledge is attained.</p>

    <p>In the practice of vipassana meditation, it is important to follow the example of a person who tries to make fire. To make a fire in the days before matches, a person had to constantly rub two sticks together without the slightest break in motion. As the sticks became hotter and hotter, more effort was needed, and the rubbing had to be carried out incessantly. Only when the fire had been produced was the person at liberty to take a rest. Similarly, a yogi should work hard so that there is no break between the preceding noting and the one which follows, and the preceding concentration and the one which follows. He should revert to his usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" after he has noted painful sensations.</p>

    <p>While being thus occupied with his usual exercise, he may again feel itching sensations somewhere in the body. He should then fix his mind on the spot and make a note as "itching, itching." Itching is an unpleasant sensation. As soon as it is felt, there arises a mind which wants to rub or scratch. This mind should be noted as "wanting, wanting," after which no rubbing or scratching must be done as yet, but a return should be made to the itching and a note made as "itching, itching." While one is occupied with contemplation in this manner, itching in most cases passes away and the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should then be reverted to.</p>

    <p>If, on the other hand, it is found that itching does not pass away, but that it is necessary to rub or scratch, the contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out by noting the mind as "wanting, wanting." It should then be continued by noting "raising, raising" on raising the hand, "touching, touching" when the hand touches the spot, "rubbing, rubbing" or "scratching, scratching" when the hand rubs or scratches, "withdrawing, withdrawing" on withdrawing the hand, "touching, touching" when the hand touches the body, and then the usual contemplation of "rising, falling" should be continued. In every case of changing postures, contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out similarly and carefully.</p>

    <p>While thus carefully proceeding with the contemplation, one may find that painful feelings or unpleasant sensations arise in the body of their own accord. Ordinarily, people change their posture as soon as they feel even the slightest unpleasant sensation of tiredness or heat without taking heed of these incidents. The change of posture is carried out quite heedlessly just while the seed of pain is beginning to grow. Thus painful feelings fail to take place in a distinctive manner. For this reason it is said that, as a rule, the postures hide painful feelings from view. People generally think that they are feeling well for days and nights on end. They think that painful feelings occur only at the time of an attack of a dangerous disease.</p>

    <p>Reality is just the opposite of what people think. Let anyone try to see how long he can keep himself in a sitting posture without moving or changing it. One will find it uncomfortable after a short while, say five or ten minutes, and then one will begin to find it unbearable after fifteen or twenty minutes. One will then be compelled to move or change one's posture by either raising or lowering the head, moving the hands or legs, or by swaying the body either forward or backward. Many movements usually take place during a short time, and the number would be very large if they were to be counted for the length of just one day. However, no one appears to be aware of this fact because no one takes any heed.</p>

    <p>Such is the order in every case, while in the case of a yogi who is always mindful of his actions and who is proceeding with contemplation, body impressions in their own respective nature are therefore distinctly noticed. They cannot help but reveal themselves fully in their own nature because he is watching until they come to full view.</p>

    <p>Though a painful sensation arises, he keeps on noting it. He does not ordinarily attempt to change his posture or move. Then on the arising of mind wanting to change, he at once makes a note of it as "wanting, wanting," and afterwards he returns again to the painful sensation and continues his noting of it. He changes his posture or moves only when he finds the painful feeling unbearable. In this case he also begins by noting the wanting mind and proceeds with noting carefully each stage in the process of moving. This is why the postures can no longer hide painful sensations. Often a yogi finds painful sensations creeping from here and there or he may feel hot sensations, aching sensations, itching, or the whole body as a mass of painful sensations. That is how painful sensations are found to be predominant because the postures cannot cover them.</p>

    <p>If he intends to change his posture from sitting to standing, he should first make a note of the intending mind as "intending, intending," and proceed with the arranging of the hands and legs in the successive stages by noting as "raising," "moving," "stretching," "touching," "pressing," and so forth. When the body sways forward, it should be noted as "swaying, swaying." While in the course of standing up, there occurs in the body a feeling of lightness as well as the act of rising. Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as "rising, rising." The act of rising should be carried out slowly.</p>

    <p>During the course of practice it is most appropriate if a yogi acts feebly and slowly in all activities just like a weak, sick person. Perhaps the case of a person suffering from lumbago would be a more fitting example here. The patient must always be cautious and move slowly just to avoid pains. In the same manner a yogi should always try to keep to slow movements in all actions. Slow motion is necessary to enable mindfulness, concentration and knowledge to catch up. One has lived all the time in a careless manner and one just begins seriously to train oneself in keeping the mind within the body. It is only the beginning, and one's mindfulness, concentration and knowledge have not yet been properly geared up while the physical and mental processes are moving at top speed. It is thus imperative to bring the top-level speed of these processes to the lowest gear so as to make it possible for mindfulness and knowledge to keep pace with them. It is therefore desirable that slow motion exercises be carried out at all times.</p>

    <p>Further, it is advisable for a yogi to behave like a blind person throughout the course of training. A person without any restraint will not look dignified because he usually looks at things and persons wantonly. He also cannot obtain a steady and calm state of mind. The blind person, on the other hand, behaves in a composed manner by sitting sedately with downcast eyes. He never turns in any direction to look at things or persons because he is blind and cannot see them. Even if a person comes near him and speaks to him, he never turns around and looks at that person. This composed manner is worthy of imitation. A yogi should act in the same manner while carrying out the practice of contemplation. He should not look anywhere. His mind should be solely intent on the object of contemplation. While in the sitting posture he must be intently noting "rising, falling." Even if strange things occur nearby, he should not look at them. He must simply make a note as "seeing, seeing" and then continue with the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling." A yogi should have a high regard for this exercise and carry it out with due respect, so much so as to be mistaken for a blind person.</p>

    <p>In this respect certain girl-yogis were found to be in perfect form. They carefully carried out the exercise with all due respect in accordance with the instructions. Their manner was very composed and they were always intent on their objects of contemplation. They never looked round. When they walked, they were always intent on the steps. Their steps were light, smooth and slow. Every yogi should follow their example.</p>

    <p>It is necessary for a yogi to behave like a deaf person also. Ordinarily, as soon as a person hears a sound, he turns around and looks in the direction from which the sound came, or he turns towards the person who spoke to him and makes a reply. He does not behave in a sedate manner. A deaf person, on the other hand, behaves in a composed manner. He does not take heed of any sound or talk because he never hears them. Similarly, a yogi should conduct himself in like manner without taking heed of any unimportant talk, nor should he deliberately listen to any talk or speech. If he happens to hear any sound or speech, he should at once make a note as "hearing, hearing," and then return to the usual practice of noting "rising, falling." He should proceed with his contemplation intently, so much so as to be mistaken for a deaf person.</p>

    <p>It should be remembered that the <i>only</i> concern of a yogi is the carrying out intently of contemplation. Other things seen or heard are not his concern. Even though they may appear to be strange or interesting, he should not take heed of them. When he sees any sights, he must ignore them as if he does not see. So too, he must ignore voices or sounds as if he does not hear. In the case of bodily actions, he must act slowly and feebly as if he were sick and very weak.</p>

    <h2 translation="其它练习">Other Exercises</h2>

    <h3>Walking</h3>

    <p>It is therefore to be emphasized that the act of pulling up the body to the standing posture should be carried out slowly. On coming to an erect position, a note should be made as "standing, standing." If one happens to look around, a note should be made as "looking, seeing," and on walking each step should be noted as "right step, left step" or "walking, walking." At each step, attention should be fixed on the sole of the foot as it moves from the point of lifting the leg to the point of placing it down.</p>

    <p>While walking in quick steps or taking a long walk, a note on one section of each step as "right step, left step" or "walking, walking" will do. In the case of walking slowly, each step may be divided into three sections &mdash; lifting, moving forward and placing down. In the beginning of the exercise, a note should be made of the two parts of each step: as "lifting" by fixing the attention on the upward movement of the foot from the beginning to the end, and as "placing" by fixing on the downward movement from the beginning to the end. Thus the exercise which starts with the first step by noting as "lifting, placing" now ends.</p>

    <p>Normally, when the foot is put down and is being noted as "placing," the other leg begins lifting to begin the next step. This should not be allowed to happen. The next step should begin only after the first step has been completed, such as "lifting, placing" for the first step and "lifting, placing" for the second step. After two or three days this exercise will be easy, and then the yogi should carry out the exercise of noting each step in three sections as "lifting, moving, placing." For the present a yogi should start the exercise by noting as "right step, left step," or "walking, walking" while walking quickly, and by noting as "lifting, placing" while walking slowly.</p>

    <h3>Sitting</h3>

    <p>While one is walking, one may feel the desire to sit down. One should then make a note as "wanting." If one then happens to look up, note it as "looking, seeing, looking, seeing"; on going to the seat as "lifting, placing"; on stopping as "stopping, stopping"; on turning as "turning, turning." When one feels a desire to sit, note it as "wanting, wanting." In the act of sitting there occur in the body heaviness and also a downward pull. Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as "sitting, sitting, sitting." After having sat down there will be movements of bringing the hands and legs into position. They should be noted as "moving," "bending," "stretching," and so forth. If there is nothing to do and if one is sitting quietly, one should then revert to the usual exercise of noting as "rising, falling."</p>

    <h3>Lying Down</h3>

    <p>If in the course of contemplation one feels painful or tired or hot, one should make a note of these and then revert to the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling." If one feels sleepy, one should make a note of it as "sleepy, sleepy" and proceed with the noting of all acts in preparation to lie down: note the bringing into position of the hands and legs as "raising," "pressing," "moving," "supporting"; when the body sways as "swaying, swaying"; when the legs stretch as "stretching, stretching"; and when the body drops and lies flat as "lying, lying, lying."</p>

    <p>These trifling acts in lying down are also important and they should not be neglected. There is every possibility of attaining enlightenment during this short time. On the full development of concentration and knowledge, enlightenment is attainable during the present moment of bending or stretching. In this way the Venerable Ananda attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down.</p>

    <p>About the beginning of the fourth month after the Buddha's complete passing away, arrangements were made to hold the first council of bhikkhus to collectively classify, examine, confirm and recite all the teachings of the Buddha. At that time five hundred bhikkhus were chosen for this work. Of these bhikkhus, four hundred and ninety-nine were Arahats, while the Venerable Ananda was a <i>sotapanna,</i> a stream-enterer.</p>

    <p>In order to attend the council as an Arahant on the same level with the others, he made his utmost effort to carry on with his meditation on the day prior to the opening of the council. That was on the fourth of the waning moon of the month of Savana (August). He proceeded with mindfulness of the body and continued his walking meditation throughout the night. It might have been in the same manner as noting "right step, left step" or "walking, walking." He was thus occupied with intense contemplation of the processes of mentality and materiality in each step until dawn of the following day, but he still had not yet attained to Arahatship.</p>

    <p>Then the Venerable Ananda thought: "I have done my utmost. Lord Buddha has said: 'Ananda, you possess full perfections <i>(paramis).</i> Do proceed with the practice of meditation. You will surely attain Arahatship one day.' I have tried my best, so much so that I can be counted as one of those who have done their best in meditation. What maybe the reason for my failure?"</p>

    <p>Then he remembered: "Ah! I have been overzealous in keeping solely to the practice of walking throughout the night. There is an excess of energy and not enough concentration, which indeed is responsible for this state of restlessness. It is now necessary to stop walking practice so as to bring energy in balance with concentration and to proceed with the contemplation in a lying position." The Venerable Ananda then entered his room, sat down on his bed, and began to lie down. It is said that he attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down, or rather at the moment of contemplating as "lying, lying."</p>

    <p>This manner of attaining Arahatship has been recorded as a strange event in the Commentaries, because it is outside the four regular postures of standing, sitting, lying and walking. At the moment of his enlightenment, the Venerable Ananda could not be regarded as strictly in a standing posture because his feet were off the floor, nor could he be regarded as sitting because his body was already at an angle, being quite close to the pillow, nor could he be regarded as lying down since his head had not yet touched the pillow and his body was not yet flat.</p>

    <p>The Venerable Ananda was a stream-enterer and he thus had to develop the three other higher stages &mdash; the path and fruit of once-returning, the path and fruit of non-returning, and the path and fruit of Arahatship in his final attainment. This took only a moment. Extreme care is therefore needed to carry on the practice of contemplation without relaxation or omission.</p>

    <p>In the act of lying down, contemplation should therefore be carried out with due care. When a yogi feels sleepy and wants to lie down, a note should be made as "sleepy, sleepy," "wanting, wanting"; on raising the hand as "raising, raising"; on stretching as "stretching, stretching"; on touching as "touching, touching"; on pressing as "pressing, pressing"; after swaying the body and dropping it down as "lying, lying." The act of lying down itself should be carried out very slowly. On touching the pillow it should be noted as "touching, touching." There are many places of touch all over the body but each spot need be noted only one at a time.</p>

    <p>In the lying posture there are also many movements of the body in bringing one's arms and legs into position. These actions should be noted carefully as "raising," "stretching," "bending," "moving," and so forth. On turning the body a note should be made as "turning, turning," and when there is nothing in particular to be noted, the yogi should proceed with the usual practice of noting "rising, falling." While one is lying on one's back or side, there is usually nothing in particular to be noted and the usual exercise of "rising, falling" should be carried out.</p>

    <p>There may be many times when the mind wanders while one is in the lying posture. This wandering mind should be noted as "going, going" when it goes out, as "arriving, arriving" when it reaches a place, as "planning," "reflecting," and so forth for each state in the same manner as in the contemplation while in the sitting posture. Mental states pass away on being noted once or twice. The usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued. There may also be instances of swallowing or spitting saliva, painful sensations, hot sensations, itching sensations, etc., or of bodily actions in changing positions or in moving the limbs. They should be contemplated as each occurs. (When sufficient strength in concentration is gained, it will be possible to carry on with the contemplation of each act of opening and closing the eyelids and blinking.) Afterwards, one should then return to the usual exercise when there is nothing else to be noted.</p>

    <h3>Sleep</h3>

    <p>Though it is late at night and time for sleep, it is not advisable to give up the contemplation and go to sleep. Anyone who has a keen interest in contemplation must be prepared to face the risk of spending many nights without sleep.</p>

    <p>The scriptures are emphatic on the necessity of developing the qualities of four-factored energy <i>(caturanga-viriya)</i> in the practice of meditation: "In the hard struggle, one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin, bones and sinews when one's flesh and blood wither and dry up, but one should not give up one's efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance, energy and endeavor." These instructions should be followed with a strong determination. It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough concentration to beat off sleep, but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper hand.</p>

    <p>When one feels sleepy, one should make a note of it as "sleepy, sleepy"; when the eyelids are heavy as "heavy, heavy"; when the eyes are felt to be dazzled as "dazzled, dazzled." After contemplating in the manner indicated, one may be able to shake off sleepiness and feel fresh again. This feeling should be noted as "feeling fresh, feeling fresh," after which the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued. However, in spite of this determination, one may feel unable to keep awake if one is very sleepy. In a lying posture, it is easier to fall asleep. A beginner should therefore try to keep mostly to the postures of sitting and walking.</p>

    <p>When the night is advanced, however, a yogi may be compelled to lie down and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling. In this position he may perhaps fall asleep. While one is asleep, it is not possible to carry on with the work of contemplation. It is an interval for a yogi to relax. An hour's sleep will give him an hour's relaxation, and if he continues to sleep for two, three or four hours, he will be relaxed for that much longer, but it is not advisable for a yogi to sleep for more than four hours, which is ample enough for a normal sleep.</p>

    <h3>Waking</h3>

    <p>A yogi should begin his contemplation from the moment of awakening. To be fully occupied with intense contemplation throughout his waking hours is the routine of a yogi who works hard with true aspiration for the attainment of the path and fruit. If it is not possible to catch the moment of awakening, he should begin with the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling." If he first becomes aware of the fact of reflecting, he should begin his contemplation by noting "reflecting, reflecting" and then revert to the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling." If he first becomes aware of hearing a voice or some other sound, he should begin by noting "hearing, hearing" and then revert to the usual exercise. On awakening there may be bodily movement in turning to this side or that, moving the hands or legs and so forth. These actions should be contemplated in successive order.</p>

    <p>If he first becomes aware of the mental states leading to the various actions of body, he should begin his contemplation by noting the mind. If he first becomes aware of painful sensations, he should begin with the noting of these painful sensations and then proceed with the noting of bodily actions. If he remains quiet without moving, the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued. If he intends to get up, he should note this as "intending, intending" and then proceed with the noting of all actions in serial order in bringing the hands and legs into position. One should note "raising, raising" on raising the body, "sitting, sitting" when the body is erect and in a sitting posture, and one should also note any other actions of bringing the legs and hands into position. If there is then nothing in particular to be noted, the usual exercise of noting "rising,falling" should be reverted to.</p>

    <p>Thus far we have mentioned things relating to the objects of contemplation in connection with the four postures and changing from one posture to another. This is merely a description of the general outline of major objects of contemplation to be carried out in the course of practice. Yet in the beginning of the practice, it is difficult to follow up on all of them in the course of contemplation. Many things will be omitted, but on gaining sufficient strength in concentration, it is easy to follow up in the course of contemplation not only those objects already enumerated, but may many more. With the gradual development of mindfulness and concentration, the pace of knowledge quickens, and thus many more objects can be perceived. It is necessary to work up to this high level.</p>

    <h3>Washing and Eating</h3>

    <p>Contemplation should be carried out in washing the face in the morning or when taking a bath. As it is necessary to act quickly in such instances due to the nature of the action itself, contemplation should be carried out as far as these circumstances will allow. On stretching the hand to catch hold of the dipper, it should be noted as "stretching, stretching"; on catching hold of the dipper as "holding, holding"; on immersing the dipper as "dipping,dipping"; on bringing the dipper towards the body as "bringing, bringing"; on pouring the water over the body or on the face as "pouring, pouring"; on feeling cold as "cold, cold"; on rubbing as "rubbing, rubbing," and so forth.</p>

    <p>There are also many different bodily actions in changing or arranging one's clothing, in arranging the bed or bed-sheets, in opening the door, and so on. These actions should be contemplated in detail serially as much as possible.</p>

    <p>At the time of taking a meal, contemplation should begin from the moment of looking at the table and noted as "looking, seeing, looking, seeing"; when stretching the hand to the plate as "stretching, stretching"; when the hand touches the food as "touching, hot, hot"; when gathering the food as "gathering, gathering"; when catching hold of the food as "catching, catching"; after lifting when the hand is being brought up as "bringing, bringing"; when the neck is being bent down as "bending, bending"; when the food is being placed in the mouth as "placing, placing"; when withdrawing the hand as "withdrawing, withdrawing"; when the hand touches the plate as "touching, touching"; when the neck is being straightened as "straightening, straightening"; when chewing the food as "chewing, chewing"; while tasting the food as "tasting, tasting," when one likes the taste as "liking, liking"; when one finds it pleasant as "pleasant, pleasant"; when swallowing as "swallowing, swallowing."</p>

    <p>This is an illustration of the routine of contemplation on partaking of each morsel of food till the meal is finished. In this case too it is difficult to follow up on all actions at the beginning of the practice. There will be many omissions. Yogis should not hesitate, however, but must try to follow up as much as they can. With the gradual advancement of the practice, it will be easier to note many more objects than are mentioned here.</p>

    <p>The instructions for the practical exercise of contemplation are now almost complete. As they have been explained in detail and at some length, it will not be easy to remember all of them. For the sake of easy remembrance, a short summary of the important and essential points will be given.</p>

    <h2 translation="要点总结">Summary of Essential Points</h2>

    <p translation="行走的时候，修习者应当觉知每一步的移动。快步走时，每一步都觉知“左、右”，注意力放在脚底。慢步走时，每一步都觉知“抬起、落下”。坐着的时候，通常的练习是觉知腹部的移动，觉知“起、伏”。躺着的时候也是如此。">In walking, a yogi should contemplate the movements of each step. While one is walking briskly, each step should be noted as "right step, left step" respectively. The mind should be fixed intently on the sole of the foot in the movements of each step. While one is in the course of walking slowly, each step should be noted in two parts as "lifting, placing." While one is in a sitting posture, the usual exercise of contemplation should be carried out by noting the movements of the abdomen as "rising, falling, rising, falling." The same manner of contemplation by noting the movements as "rising, falling, rising, falling" should be carried out while one is also in the lying posture.</p>

    <p translation="如果在觉知“起、伏”时，察觉到有走神，应当停止继续走神，并立即觉知。对于想象，觉知“想象、想象”；对于思考，觉知“思考、思考”；如果注意力飘走了，觉知“飘走、飘走”；如果飘到某处，觉知“到达、到达”，等等。然后回到觉知腹部起伏的练习。">If it is found that the mind wanders during the course of noting "rising, falling," it should not be allowed to continue to wander but should be noted immediately. On imagining, it should be noted as "imagining, imagining"; on thinking as "thinking, thinking"; on the mind going out as "going, going"; on the mind arriving at a place as "arriving, arriving," and so forth at every occurrence, and then the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling" should be continued.</p>

    <p translation="当感到四肢疲倦，或者感觉热、痛、痒，应立即觉知“疲倦”、“热”、“痛”、“痒”，等等。然后回到觉知腹部起伏的练习。">When there occur feelings of tiredness in the hands, legs or other limbs, or hot, prickly, aching or itching sensations, they should be immediately followed up and noted as "tired," "hot," "prickly," "aching," "itching," and so on as the case may be. A return should then be made to the usual exercise of noting "rising, falling."</p>

    <p translation="当屈伸手腿，移动四肢脖子，或前后晃动身体时，应立即觉知。然后回到觉知腹部起伏的练习。">When there are acts of bending or stretching the hands or legs, or moving the neck or limbs or swaying the body to and fro, they should be followed up and noted in serial order as they occur. The usual exercise of noting as "rising, falling" should then be reverted to.</p>

    <p translation="以上只是总结。在日常小参[interview]的时候，冥想老师会提到其它需要觉知的对象。">This is only a summary. Any other objects to be contemplated in the course of training will be mentioned by the meditation teachers when giving instructions during the daily interview with the disciples.</p>

    <p translation="如此练习，觉知对象的数量会逐渐增加。一开始会经常走神，所以有很多觉知不到的。修习者不要失去信心。对初学者来说，这是常见的困难。过段时间，走神的时候能够及时察觉，注意力便稳定下来，固定在它所指向的对象上。">If one proceeds with the practice in the manner indicated, the number of objects will gradually increase in the course of time. At first there will be many omissions because the mind is used to wandering without any restraint whatsoever. However, a yogi should not lose heart on this account. This difficulty is usually encountered in the beginning of practice. After some time, the mind can no longer play truant because it is always found out every time it wanders. It therefore remains fixed on the object to which it is directed.</p>

    <p translation="腹部起伏降时，通过心识觉知，对象和心识就相合了。每次觉知，总是有对象和了解该对象的心识。借此我们了解到，只有物质—心识过程，而没有一个所谓的人或自我。">As rising occurs the mind makes a note of it, and thus the object and the mind coincide. As falling occurs the mind makes a note of it, and thus the object and the mind coincide. There is always a pair, the object and the mind which knows the object, at each time of noting. These two elements of the material object and the knowing mind always arise in pairs, and apart from these two there does not exist any other thing in the form of a person or self. This reality will be personally realized in due course.</p>

    <p translation="腹部起伏时，我们清楚地体验到物质和心识是两个不同的过程。腹部的起伏和了解腹部起伏的心识总是成对出现。对于行走时脚的“抬起”、“移动”、“落下”，也是如此。这个认识被称为 nama-rupa-pariccheda-ñana，即分辨物质与心识。这是内观智慧的开始，十分重要。">The fact that materiality and mentality are two distinct, separate things will be clearly perceived during the time of noting "rising, falling." The two elements of materiality and mentality are linked up in pairs and their arising coincides, that is, the process of materiality in rising arises with the process of mentality which knows it. The process of materiality in falling falls away together with the process of mentality which knows it. It is the same for lifting, moving and placing: these are processes of materiality arising and falling away together with the processes of mentality which know them. This knowledge in respect of matter and mind rising separately is known as <i>nama-rupa-pariccheda-&ntilde;ana,</i> the discriminating knowledge of mentality-materiality. It is the preliminary stage in the whole course of insight knowledge. It is important to have this preliminary stage developed in a proper manner.</p>

    <p translation="持续练习一段时间，正念和专注会有明显进步。在这个程度能够体验到，每个瞬间，伴随着觉知，事物出现又消失。但是没有练习的人会认为，有一个我，它的身体从童年到成年，它的心识从幼稚到成熟，身体和心识是同一的。事实并非如此。没有什么是恒常的。万事万物在瞬间出现又消失，发生得很快。通过练习，我们可以感知的到。">On continuing the practice of contemplation for some time, there will be considerable progress in mindfulness and concentration. At this high level it will be perceptible that on every occasion of noting, each process arises and passes away at that very moment. But, on the other hand, uninstructed people generally consider that the body and mind remain in a permanent state throughout life, that the same body of childhood has grown up into adulthood, that the same young mind has grown up into maturity, and that both body and mind are one and the same person. In reality, this is not so. Nothing is permanent. Everything comes into existence for a moment and then passes away. Nothing can remain even for the blink of an eye. Changes are taking place very swiftly and they will be perceived in due course.</p>

    <p translation="继续如此练习，我们会感知到紧随着一个事物的消失，会有另一个事物出现，接连不断。通过觉知，体验到事物的消失，修习者知道没有什么是恒常的，他证得无常（aniccanupassana-ñana）。">While carrying on the contemplation by noting "rising, falling" and so forth, one will perceive that these processes arise and pass away one after another in quick succession. On perceiving that everything passes away at the very point of noting, a yogi knows that nothing is permanent. This knowledge regarding the impermanent nature of things is <i>aniccanupassana-&ntilde;ana,</i> the contemplative knowledge of impermanence.</p>

    <p translation="于是，修习者认识到，无常使人苦恼。在经历过很多痛苦的感觉之后，他认为这个身体—心识的复合体只是一堆苦难。于是，他证得苦（dukkhanupassana-ñana）">A yogi then knows that this ever-changing state of things is distressing and is not to be desired. This is <i>dukkhanupassana-&ntilde;ana,</i> the contemplative knowledge of suffering. On suffering many painful feelings, this body and mind complex is regarded as a mere heap of suffering. This is also contemplative knowledge of suffering.</p>

    <p translation="于是，修习者认识到，物质和心识不随我们的意愿，而是依从它们的特质和环境。通过觉知，他认识到这个过程是不可控的，并没有一个人或自我。他证见无我（anattanupassana-ñana）。">It is then perceived that the elements of materiality and mentality never follow one's wish, but arise according to their own nature and conditioning. While being engaged in the act of noting these processes, a yogi understands that these processes are not controllable and that they are neither a person nor a living entity nor self. This is <i>anattanupassana-&ntilde;ana,</i> the contemplative knowledge of non-self.</p>

    <p translation="当修习者获得了无常、苦和无我的智慧，便证见涅盘。自古以来，通过这个方法，佛陀、阿罗汉和圣者证见涅盘。这是通向涅盘的捷径。内观包含四念住，即在四个方面运用正念。运用正念即是通往涅盘的捷径。">When a yogi has fully developed the knowledge of impermanence, suffering and non-self, he will realize Nibbana. From time immemorial, Buddhas, Arahats and Ariyas (noble ones) have realized Nibbana by this method of vipassana. It is the highway leading to Nibbana. Vipassana consists of the four <i>satipatthana,</i> applications of mindfulness, and it is <i>satipatthana</i> which is really the highway to Nibbana.</p>

    <p translation="修习者应当清楚，这个捷径是佛陀、阿罗汉和圣者所实践的。能够知晓这个捷径，既是不懈追求的结果，也是因为当下时机成熟。也应当清除，坚定地走此捷径，会让专注力和智慧高度发展，正如佛陀、阿罗汉和圣者那样。借由前所未有的专注力，体验到纯粹的喜悦之情。">Yogis who take up this course of training should bear in mind that they are on the highway which has been taken by Buddhas, Arahats and Ariyas. This opportunity is afforded them apparently because of their <i>parami,</i> that is, their previous endeavors in seeking and wishing for it, and also because of their present mature conditions. They should rejoice at heart for having this opportunity. They should also feel assured that by walking on this highway without wavering they will gain personal experience of highly developed concentration and wisdom, as has already been known by Buddhas, Arahats and Ariyas. They will develop such a pure state of concentration as has never been known before in the course of their lives and thus enjoy many innocent pleasures as a result of advanced concentration.</p>

    <p translation="通过直接地体验无常、苦和无我，充分发展无常、苦和无我的智慧，证见涅盘。达到这个目标，无需很长时间。可能是一个月，或二十天，或十五天，或者七天。最后一种情况很少见。">Impermanence, suffering and non-self will be realized through direct personal experience, and with the full development of these knowledges, Nibbana will be realized. It will not take long to achieve the objective, possibly one month, or twenty days, or fifteen days, or, on rare occasions, even in seven days for those select few with extraordinary <i>parami.</i></p>

    <p translation="因此，修习者应当以极大的热情和信心进行练习，相信该方法一定会将自己引向圣途和正果，并最终抵达涅盘。于是，修习者摆脱自我的错误认识和精神上的疑虑，并从重生入恶境的轮回中解脱出来。，">Yogis should therefore proceed with the practice of contemplation in great earnestness and with full confidence, trusting that it will surely lead to the development of the noble path and fruit and to the realization of Nibbana. They will then be free from the wrong view of self and from spiritual doubt, and they will no longer be subject to the round of rebirth in the miserable realms of the hells, the animal world, and the sphere of petas.</p>

    <p translation="愿修习者以他们崇高的努力获得成功。">May yogis meet with every success in their noble endeavor.</p>
